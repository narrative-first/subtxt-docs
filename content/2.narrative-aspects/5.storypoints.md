title: Storypoints
description: "Key thematic elements that shape your narrative's meaning"
---

**Storypoints** represent the core ideas and themes that run throughout your story, providing a way to express its deeper meaning and thematic essence. Organized by **Throughline**, Storypoints help authors pinpoint and articulate the unique aspects of conflict from various perspectives, reinforcing how and why the story unfolds.  

At their core, Storypoints are a way to **identify the source of conflict** in a given perspective. To fully explore a narrative's meaning, Subtxt introduces a structured method of discovery:  

## **The Four Layers of Identifying a Source of Conflict**

Every conflict in a story operates within a **Perspective** (I, You, We, They). From this vantage point, we uncover the nature of its inequity by moving through four distinct layers of understanding:

1. **Domain** – What is the general nature of the conflict? (Universe, Physics, Psychology, Mind)
2. **Concern** – How does the conflict manifest within its environment? (Past, Progress, Understanding, Memory, etc.)
3. **Issue** – What specific thematic characteristic of this conflict is in focus? (Truth, Evidence, Desire, Skill, etc.)
4. **Problem** – What underlying tensions sustain the inequity? (Problem/Solution/Focus/Direction)

This structured approach ensures that every Storypoint not only categorizes conflict but also reveals **why the imbalance persists** within the story's framework.

## **Understanding Storypoints by Throughline**  

Each **Throughline**—Objective Story, Main Character, Influence Character, and Relationship Story—has its own set of Storypoints, which reflect a unique **Perspective** on the central conflict. While all Throughlines may share thematic similarities, their expressions and interactions differ according to their **Domain, Concern, Issue, and Problem** and the **Dynamics** that influence them.

### **The Essential Four**

For each Throughline, there are four primary Storypoints essential to developing your narrative:

1. **Domain** – Establishes the **nature** of the conflict, shaping how it is perceived and experienced.
2. **Concern** – Defines **where** the conflict takes place and how it interacts within its context.
3. **Issue** – Identifies **which specific thematic aspect** of the conflict is highlighted, adding depth and nuance.
4. **Problem** – Reveals the underlying **tensions that sustain** the conflict, driving its persistence and evolution. 

The Storypoints—Domain, Concern, Issue, and Problem—allow us to view conflicts not merely as labels but as active tools for understanding narrative tensions. Rather than simplifying a story into static categories, this approach ensures each Throughline is shaped by the underlying forces that maintain its conflict.

By progressing through **Domain → Concern → Issue → Problem**, every Storypoint provides a clear insight into the deeper meaning of conflict—highlighting not only what it is, but also how it continues, influences the narrative, and ultimately, why it is significant.

## **Additional Storypoints for Depth**  

Beyond the essential four, each Throughline can include additional Storypoints to further **clarify the forces at play** in the narrative:  

- **Focus, Direction, Solution, and Benchmark** – These Storypoints refine the **specific areas of inequity and movement** within the conflict.  
- **Unique Abilities & Critical Flaws** – (specific to the Main Character and Influence Character Throughlines) – Highlighting key personal strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Catalysts & Inhibitors** – (specific to the Objective Story and Relationship Story Throughlines) – Influencing the pacing and escalation of conflict.

## **Special Relationship Story Appreciations**  

The **Relationship Story Throughline** differs from the standard structure, emphasizing movement and balance over direct problem-solving.  

- Instead of **Problem**, we use **Condition**, and instead of **Solution**, we use **Adjustment**—focusing on the conditions and shifts that shape the relationship.  
- Instead of **Focus and Direction**, we use **Resistance and Flow**, emphasizing how relationships develop and evolve over time.  

These modifications highlight that the **Relationship Story** functions differently than other Throughlines—it is not about **solving** conflict but rather **understanding the shifting dynamics** between characters.

## **The Influence of Serotonin on Narrative**  

When the **Narrative Alignment** is set to **Serotonin**, all Throughlines adopt the **Condition/Adjustment/Resistance/Flow** framework. This reflects a **non-linear approach to conflict**, where tension is experienced as an ongoing process rather than a fixed problem to be solved.  

---

## **Objective Story Static Story Points**  

The **Objective Story Throughline** includes additional Storypoints that provide a **structural foundation for the plot**:  

- **Story Goal** – The desired resolution to the primary conflict.  
- **Story Consequence** – What happens if the Story Goal is not achieved.  

In **Serotonin-aligned** stories, these points are reframed:  
- The **Condition for conflict** becomes **Story Intention**, representing the underlying purpose or aim.  
- Its balance shifts into **Story Overwhelm**, capturing the weight of ongoing uncertainty.  

These shifts help convey the unique challenges and **perspectives on conflict** in different types of narratives.

## **Additional Objective Story Storypoints**  

While not essential, developing these additional Storypoints can **enhance thematic depth**:  

- **Story Requirements** – What must be done to achieve the Goal.  
- **Story Prerequisites, Preconditions, and Dividends** – The stepping stones toward success and their benefits.  
- **Story Costs and Forewarnings** – The sacrifices made and the looming signs of failure.  

These **structural elements** refine how your story unfolds, making sure every piece contributes to the **larger narrative argument**.

## **Working with Storypoints**  

Storypoints are organized by Throughline and can be found within the **Forming** section in the **Develop Workspace** or above a **Storyform** in the **Muse Workspace**.  

After developing the essential Storypoints, you can surface them into a **Storypoint Overview**, which visually summarizes the core ideas of each Throughline. This structured approach ensures that your story’s **narrative argument remains clear, intentional, and thematically rich**.
