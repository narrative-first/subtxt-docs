## Overviews: A Tool for the Author

**Overviews** serve as high-level summaries designed **exclusively for the author**. They are not referenced by the platform in developing stories but exist as a tool to help authors articulate and organize their narrative vision. Overviews summarize the underlying **subtext** of a story, reinforcing the fundamental distinction between storytelling (fluid and adaptable) and narrative structure (fixed and meaningful).

## The Inside-Out Approach to Narrative

The Subtxt/Dramatica platform follows an **inside-out approach**, meaning that the **narrative structure** forms the foundation of a story, while storytelling elements emerge from this foundation. This distinction is visually represented within the platform—everything **below** the curved **narrative structure line** is used for shaping the story, while everything **above** the line, including storytelling, remains fluid and adaptable.

Overviews reside **above** this line. They do not dictate or influence the platform's structural analysis but act as a **convenient reference for the author**, summarizing deeper narrative meanings in a digestible format.

## What Overviews Cover

Overviews encapsulate broad storytelling elements such as:

- **Throughline summaries** – Big-picture descriptions of the Objective Story, Main Character, Influence Character, and Relationship Story.
- **Plot synopses** – Summaries of major story movements.
- **Character arcs** – Broad outlines of how key characters evolve.
- **Genre and stylistic concerns** – Definitions of tone, mood, and other creative decisions.

While these elements are valuable for structuring a story, they do **not** feed back into any generative story development.

## Types of Overviews

The Subtxt/Dramatica platform provides several Overview types, each serving a different function:

1. **Logline** – A concise summary of the story’s core conflict and stakes.
2. **Genre Overview** – Defines the tone, mood, and stylistic decisions of the story.
3. **Throughline Overviews** – Summarize each of the four Throughlines.
4. **Plot Synopsis** – A broad summary of the major narrative beats.
5. **Character Relationship Overviews** – Outline interactions and dynamics between key characters.
6. **Character Arcs** – High-level descriptions of character growth and transformation.
7. **Storypoint Synopses** – Provide context for specific story beats within each Throughline.

## How to Use Overviews

### 1. Creating Overviews
Overviews can be created directly in the **Develop Workspace** under the Overviews tab. They can also be manually written or generated using Muse by requesting summaries or descriptions. Additionally, Overviews can be **automatically generated** by clicking the **up-arrow "Surface Subtext into Storytelling" button**, which appears in multiple sections of the app. This button, located **directly above the curved line** that separates storytelling from narrative structure, compiles all the work beneath into a comprehensive summary for easy reference.

### 2. Using Overviews as a Reference
Since Overviews do not feed back into any narrative calculations, authors should use them **as a guide** for storytelling decisions rather than as definitive structures.

### 3. Refining Overviews Over Time
As authors update the subtext beneath their story, they can effortlessly refine their Overviews by resurfacing these deeper meanings into storytelling, ensuring coherence and alignment between structure and narrative expression.

## The Key Takeaway

Overviews in Subtxt serve as a **personal reference** for the author, providing a high-level summary of the story’s structure **without influencing their story's deeper narrative framework**. They reinforce the distinction between **subtext (fixed meaning) and storytelling (fluid interpretation)**, giving writers clarity and flexibility in shaping their stories.
