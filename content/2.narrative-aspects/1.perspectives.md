title: Perspectives
description: Exploring core conflict through distinct viewpoints

## Introduction

**Perspectives** in Subtxt enable you to explore different viewpoints within your story’s structure, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. By assigning Storypoints and Storybeats to various Perspectives, you can see how different characters or thematic arguments address the same central conflict, making it easier to track how each viewpoint contributes to the overall Throughline.

## Understanding Perspectives and Throughlines

Perspectives in Subtxt operate within the framework of the four primary **Throughlines**, which represent the different vantage points that encompass a story’s thematic conflict:

1. **Objective Story (OS)**:  
   The OS is **an objective perspective on how conflict impacts all the characters in the story**. This view frames the characters through their **objective roles**—what they are doing in terms of the larger narrative function. It’s not tied to any single character's perspective but rather looks at the story as a whole system of interacting elements.

2. **Main Character (MC)**:  
   The MC is **the audience's eyes and ears into the story**. This is the personal, subjective point of view—who the audience identifies with and experiences the story through. Importantly, **the MC is not inherently the Protagonist**; the Protagonist fulfills a specific role in driving the story’s objective plot forward, which may or may not overlap with the MC's role.

3. **Obstacle Character (OC)**:  
   The OC challenges the MC’s worldview and serves as a catalyst for the MC's growth. This can be done directly through their actions or indirectly through the impact of their presence, choices, or philosophy. The OC is integral to the MC's journey of change (or steadfastness).

4. **Relationship Story (RS)**:  
   The RS explores **the growth of a relationship** and is often referred to as the emotional "heart" of the story. While it frequently focuses on the relationship between the MC and the OC, it is not strictly limited to this pairing. The RS is about the dynamic, evolving interaction _between_ characters and how that relationship changes over the course of the story.

These Throughlines provide a structure for analyzing how different characters interact with the story’s central themes and conflicts. By utilizing **Perspectives**, you can present these Throughlines not as isolated elements, but as interconnected views that shift from one character or thematic argument to the next, creating a more cohesive and dynamic story experience.

## Creating Multiple Perspectives within a Throughline

The Perspectives feature allows you to break down a single Throughline into several different viewpoints, making it easier to see how various characters address or expose the same thematic conflict. This process is called a **handoff**: one character’s perspective on the Throughline hands off to another, maintaining the same thematic argument but enriching it with a fresh angle.

### Example: The Lego Batman Movie

In *The Lego Batman Movie*, the story revolves around Batman’s struggle with relationships and teamwork. The thematic issue of "needing to work together" is explored through the perspectives of several characters in the **Obstacle Character Throughline**:

1. **Alfred** starts by emphasizing the importance of family and teamwork, pointing out Batman’s resistance to it.
2. **Robin** continues this argument by showing excitement about joining Batman, representing the potential joy and fulfillment that can come from partnership.
3. **Barbara Gordon** picks up the argument by pushing Batman to work within the law and consider collaboration with Gotham PD.
4. **The Joker** then drives home the same thematic conflict by challenging Batman’s refusal to acknowledge the need for relationships, even with his adversaries.

Each of these characters hands off the thematic conflict to the next, providing a cohesive yet multifaceted exploration of the same Throughline: Batman’s need to accept help and work with others.

## Illustrating a Perspective  

When writing a Perspective, keep it succinct and focused, avoiding excessive detail or overt reliance on story structure terminology. This is not the place to outline the entire story of a Throughline, nor should it include so much information that the NarrativeSync tool simply repeats it back verbatim. The goal is to describe the kind of conflict the Perspective explores in a way that is impactful yet concise.  

If you get too detailed, you risk limiting the tool's creative potential. If you describe the full story, the NarrativeSync might work toward simply echoing or concluding the scenario you've described. Instead, offer just enough to inspire ideas, leaving room for the tool to add new dimensions.  

If you’re struggling, remember you can always engage the NarrativeSync tool directly within the Perspective section to generate ideas. If you already have a loose concept, jot it down in the BrainstormAI tool first, then click the brain icon to let the tool incorporate your input while crafting something fresh.  

Here’s a clear example of what works well:  

**Too Detailed and Over-Produced:**  
The overarching conflict in "Dragonwyck" centers around the societal and personal conceptualizations of power, authority, and control. The tension arises from Nicholas Van Ryn's unwavering desire to maintain feudal-like authority over his tenants, while Miranda finds herself caught amidst these oppressive surroundings. This clash between the traditional patroon system and emerging ideas of freedom and justice forms the backbone of the Objective Story.  

**Just Right:**  
In the shadowy halls of Dragonwyck Manor, Miranda Wells, a young woman with dreams of independence, becomes entangled in the sinister world of her enigmatic cousin, Nicholas Van Ryn. As she navigates the oppressive atmosphere of the estate, Miranda uncovers Nicholas's dark secrets and his ruthless grip on power, setting the stage for a battle between her quest for freedom and his tyrannical rule.  

In summary, focus on the essence of the conflict, keeping it short, evocative, and to the point. This will ensure the Perspective is both useful and flexible for the brainstorming process.

## How to Use Perspectives in Subtxt

The **Perspectives** feature helps you organize and assign **Storypoints**, **Storybeats**, and **Overviews** to specific viewpoints within a Throughline. This ensures your story’s thematic exploration remains clear while tracking its detailed structure.

### Filtering Perspectives

The Perspectives tool allows you to filter Narrative Aspects to focus on specific elements of your story:  

- **All**: Displays every Narrative Aspect, regardless of whether it’s assigned to a Perspective.  
- **Assigned**: Shows only Narrative Aspects linked to a Perspective, helping you track progress within a Throughline.  
- **Unassigned**: Lists Narrative Aspects without a Perspective, making it easy to identify what still needs to be integrated into your story.

This filtering system provides clarity and control, ensuring every part of your story is accounted for and developed.

### Assigning Narrative Aspects to Perspectives

Assigning Perspectives helps you connect Narrative Aspects—such as Storypoints, Storybeats, or Overviews—to the correct Throughline:

1. **Access the Perspectives Tool**:  
   Click the **Perspectives button** (dashed circle icon) available in the Subtxt interface.

2. **Assigning a Narrative Aspect**:  
   - Open any unassigned Narrative Aspect.  
   - Select the appropriate Perspective from the dropdown menu to link it to a Throughline.  

3. **Creating Storypoints or Storybeats for a Perspective**:  
   - If a selected Perspective has no Storypoints or Storybeats yet, click the **Illustrate** button to generate and attach new ones automatically.  

This process ensures your story is systematically structured, with each Perspective properly represented.

At this time, Muse doesn’t have the capability to assign or remove Perspectives for individual items. You’ll need to use the **Develop Workspace** for this functionality.
