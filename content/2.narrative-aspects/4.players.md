description: Understanding and developing the roles of Players within your story
---

In Subtxt, we use the term **Players** instead of "characters" to emphasize their specific roles within the **Objective Story Throughline**. Unlike traditional character roles, Players can adapt to different functions in a story; for example, a Main Character might serve as the Protagonist in one story but as the Antagonist in another. This flexible approach supports a more nuanced and versatile narrative structure.

## Where to Find Players in Subtxt

You’ll find the list of **Players** in the **Plot & Players** section of **Forming** in the **Develop Workspace**, or above a **Storyform** in the **Muse Workspace**. Here, you can add and delete Players or even generate a full cast of **Archetypal Players** based on your Story Idea or the Objective Story Throughline.

### Setting the Perspective for the Objective Story Throughline

When working with Players in your story, it's essential to set the **Perspective** for the Objective Story (OS) Throughline. This step ensures that your Players align properly within the narrative structure and fulfill their roles effectively.

Remember, the Objective Story Throughline can include multiple sets of characters, each following their own "track." To work meaningfully with these Players, you need a solid understanding of **Perspectives** and how they shape your story's dynamics.

To set the Perspective:

1. Navigate to the **upper right-hand corner** of the app.
2. Confirm or adjust the Perspective for your Objective Story Throughline.
3. Proceed with assigning and refining Players to maintain consistency and clarity in your story's structure.

Failing to set the correct Perspective can lead to misaligned character roles and confusion. Taking this crucial step before diving deeper ensures that your story remains cohesive and well-structured.

## Initial Setup and Key Players

When you first access the **Players** section, you will typically see two Players already created: one marked **Main Character** and one marked **Obstacle Character**. These Players highlight the critical concept that those who fulfill roles in their subjective Throughlines (the **Main Character Throughline** and **Obstacle Character Throughline**) also play vital parts in the **Objective Story Throughline**. These pivotal elements embody the narrative’s central argument and represent two opposing yet interconnected perspectives.

### Pivotal Elements: Unchangeable Roles

The Main Character and Obstacle Character are marked in red to indicate that they are essential and cannot be removed without disrupting the narrative's integrity. While you can add more Motivations to these Players, their core roles must remain intact.

### Developing and Surfacing Players

Working with **Players** in Subtxt involves a process of deep development and integration into the narrative. Begin by assigning **Motivations** to each Player, which are essential for defining their function relative to the **Story Goal**. To add new **Motivations**, click **Add** and select from one of the 64 available options. You can also use the **Select** button to have Subtxt suggest unassigned Motivations. While it's possible to assign the same Motivation to multiple Players, creating unique Motivations helps maintain diversity and complexity in their interactions.

Once Motivations are assigned, move beyond mere description by surfacing them into **Storytelling**. This step illustrates how each Player’s Motivations play out within the plot. If you have already defined the **Story Goal** in the **Plot** section or within the **Objective Story Throughline** of the **Illustrating** section, Subtxt will automatically integrate these contexts when you use the **BrainstormingAI** tool. This tool, located between the Motivations and Storytelling panels, enables you to refine your understanding of a Player's Motivations and explore how they drive their actions in relation to the overarching story.

Storytelling in Subtxt is always tied to the **Goal** of your narrative, making it beneficial to clearly define the **Goal** and **Consequence** (or **Intention/Overwhelm**) before diving deeply into Player development. Doing so ensures that each Player’s Motivations and roles align seamlessly with the broader narrative structure.

### Illustrating and Removing Motivations

Once a Motivation is assigned, you can write down how it manifests in the story or use the **Random Illustration** button for inspiration. Motivations can be removed at any time by clicking on the Motivation and confirming the action.

### Character Archetypes in Subtxt

Character Archetypes provide a foundational framework for understanding and assigning roles to **Players** in your narrative. Rooted in the **Dramatica theory** of story structure, Archetypal characters embody specific sets of complementary **Motivations**, streamlining the development of dynamic and engaging narratives. 

In Dramatica, each Archetypal character is defined by two core elements: one Action element (what they do) and one Decision element (how they decide). These pairs drive their behavior and relationships within the story.

#### Archetypal Characters and Their Motivations

The table below outlines the eight key Archetypal characters, their corresponding Action and Decision elements, and a brief description of their narrative function:

| Archetype      | Action Element  | Decision Element  | Narrative Function                                |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Protagonist**| Pursuit         | Consider    | Drives the story toward achieving the goal.      |
| **Antagonist** | Avoid           | Reconsider    | Seeks to prevent the goal from being achieved.   |
| **Reason**     | Logic           | Control           | Uses rationality and restraint to make decisions.|
| **Emotion**    | Feeling         | Uncontrolled      | Acts on emotional impulses and instincts.        |
| **Sidekick**   | Support         | Faith             | Offers loyalty and optimism to the Protagonist.  |
| **Skeptic**    | Oppose          | Disbelief         | Challenges ideas and doubts the Protagonist’s plans. |
| **Guardian**   | Help            | Conscience        | Guides others with wisdom and moral authority.   |
| **Contagonist**| Hinder          | Temptation        | Distracts or complicates the Protagonist’s path. |

### Assigning Archetypes in Subtxt

Subtxt automatically assigns Archetypal roles to Players based on their combination of **Motivations**. When a Player has both the listed Action and Decision elements from the table above, Subtxt identifies and assigns the corresponding Archetype. 

#### Exceptions:
- **Protagonist**: In Subtxt, a Player only needs the **Pursuit** element to qualify as the Protagonist.  
- **Antagonist**: Similarly, the Antagonist only needs the **Avoid** element to be assigned this role.

### Leveraging Archetypes in Your Story

By assigning Archetypes, you ensure that your narrative includes balanced and dynamic roles that enhance the story's overall tension and harmony. These predefined Motivations make it easier to explore character interactions and conflicts, providing a strong narrative structure.

With Subtxt’s **BrainstormingAI** tool, you can refine how these Archetypes interact with the **Story Goal** and illustrate their roles in the plot. This automated alignment saves time and enhances your ability to craft a cohesive, engaging narrative.

## Generating Character Relationships

After developing and assigning Players to the **Objective Story Throughline Perspective**, you can create a **Character Relationship Overview** by surfacing all Players. This overview, found at the top of the Players screen, provides a comprehensive map of how Players relate to each other. By surfacing Motivations into Players and then Players into relationships, Subtxt and Muse can use these dynamics to suggest relevant **Storypoints** and **Storybeats** as you shape your narrative.

Working with **Players** ensures that your story’s structure is robust and that each role is meaningful, supporting a dynamic and engaging narrative. When returning from the Narrative Agents and generating these key relationships, you can find the **Character Relationship Overview** in the **master Overviews tab** at the top of the sidebar or back in the **Players section**, where the relationships were initially generated.

To view this Character Relationship Overview and access its full benefits, make sure to set the proper **Perspective** for the Objective Story Throughline in the upper right-hand corner of the app. Without setting the Perspective, this feature will remain unavailable.

### Exploring Relationships Between Players

Relationships between Players leverage their **Motivations** to work through and define the narrative further. These connections bring depth and meaning to the story by exploring how Players interact and depend on one another. Subtxt highlights these dynamics by:

- **Exploring conflict between characters**, where opposing motivations spark compelling tension.  
- **Relating characters who complement each other**, forming partnerships that balance strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Defining bonds where characters rely on one another**, emphasizing interdependence for achieving goals.  
- **Linking characters through shared experiences and influences**, drawing on their histories and growth together.  
- **Bringing all the character connections together**, creating a cohesive web of interactions that enrich the story.  

By focusing on these relational aspects, Subtxt helps you create multidimensional Players whose interactions enhance the depth and intricacy of your narrative.

## Generating Media Cues

In addition to defining the **Motivations** and **Role** of your Players, Subtxt offers an exciting new opportunity to enrich your story further by defining how your Players will *look* and *sound*. These **Media Cues** are designed to enhance future features in Subtxt, including:

- **Auto-generation of images** for each Player.  
- **Auto-generation of voices**, enabling your Players to "read" aloud your story.  
- Seamless integration into a dynamic cast experience for your narrative.  

This is an optional but powerful tool to add a creative edge to your storytelling process.

#### How to Get Started

You can kickstart the process by using the **Narrative Agent** located at the top of the screen. This feature allows you to:

1. **Define all your Players at once:** The Narrative Agent will generate initial notes for both Visuals (how they look) and Vocals (how they sound).  
2. **Make a "first pass" at Media Cues:** These are preliminary ideas you can later refine.  

Once the Narrative Agent has completed its work, return to the **Players** tab. There, you’ll find new inputs for each Player, specifically tailored to Visuals and Vocals. These fields can be edited to match your precise vision for your story.

With Media Cues, Subtxt empowers you to bring your Players to life in an entirely new way, making your story even more immersive for your audience!
