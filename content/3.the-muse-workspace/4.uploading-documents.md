## Uploading Documents: Overview by Tier  

Subtxt users can upload documents into **Conversations**, with additional features available for **Pro** and **Infinite** tiers.

| Feature                       | **Basic**                     | **Pro**                               | **Infinite**                         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Upload to Conversations**   | 1 file per conversation       | Multiple files per conversation       | Multiple files per conversation       |
| **Upload to Stories**         | Not available                 | Available (5GB max storage)           | Available (20GB max storage)         |
| **Upload to Storyforms**      | Not available                 | Available (5GB max storage)           | Available (20GB max storage)         |


### Expanded Access for Infinite Users  

When retrieving information from documents uploaded to **Stories** or **Storyforms**, **Infinite users** have access to **5x-8x** the amount of information that **Pro users** can access. This allows Infinite users to unlock significantly deeper insights and context, making it ideal for more complex or expansive storytelling needs.

### File Size Limit  

- **Individual File Limit:** 512MB

You can only upload documents in **Muse Mode**—not in **Theory Mode** or **Storyforming Mode**. If you see "Theory" or "Storyform" at the top of Muse, this is an indication that you are in one of those modes and uploads are disabled. Switch to Muse Mode to access this feature.

### For Stories and Storyforms (Pro and Infinite Users Only):  

Pro and Infinite users can upload documents into **Stories** and **Storyforms** to provide foundational content that informs Muse’s responses across all related conversations.

#### Story Context:  

- **Purpose:** Store key worldbuilding elements, such as character backstories, locations, or outlines.  
- **Scope:** Available across all conversations and Storyforms connected to the Story.

**Note on Storyform Access**  
Due to a current limitation with our third-party API service, access to **Story documents from Storyform contexts is not available.** We expect this functionality to be ready by **Q1 2025**. Until then, you'll need to add the documents you want to use in a Storyform **directly** to that Storyform, including any documents already uploaded to a Story.
::

#### Storyform Context:  

- **Purpose:** Focused uploads for drafts, scene breakdowns, or structural analysis.  
- **Scope:** Limited to the specific Storyform.

**Need a Fresh Start?** If Muse isn’t quite getting everything, sometimes it’s best to start over fresh. When using the new Uploading feature, make sure to choose **Fresh Start**, whether you’re working in the **Develop Workspace (Documents)** or in a **Story or Storyform Context (Documents)**. When you click **Edit**, choose **Fresh Start** to clear everything and reload Muse with the right context.

## Important Note on Questions  

For the best results, ask Muse specific, targeted questions about your narrative or structure. While Muse can respond to general questions, you’ll receive the most actionable insights by being direct.  

Example prompts:  

> "How does the Relationship Story Throughline Catalyst and Inhibitor work in this draft?"  

> "What does this document reveal about the Influence Character Throughline?"  

---

## Managing Documents  

Documents can be uploaded and managed within both the **Muse** and **Develop** Workspaces.  

1. **In Muse Workspace:**  
   - Select **Documents** while working within a Story or Storyform.  
   - Upload new files or manage existing ones (rename or delete).  
   - Muse will generate a **title and summary** for each uploaded file.  

2. **In Develop Workspace:**  
   - Access the **Documents** section below **Overviews** in the navigation bar.  
   - Review and manage documents related to your Stories or Storyforms.

## Storage Limits by Tier  

| User Tier         | **Total Storage Limit**   |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Basic**          | 1 active file per conversation |
| **Pro**            | 5GB                      |
| **Infinite**       | 20GB                     |

### Automatic Document Search  

Once uploaded, Muse will automatically search through these documents when:  
- Answering questions  
- Preparing responses  
- Reviewing story elements  

To make the most of this feature, you can help Muse understand what to focus on by:  
- Referring to documents directly by their **title** or **name** as listed in the **Documents** section.  
- Asking Muse to "look at the document I uploaded" when referencing specific content.  

Muse has an extensive **Narrative Matrix** with a vast store of information, so being specific about which document you’re referencing—especially if they’re uploaded to the **Story** or **Storyform** rather than part of the current conversation—will significantly enhance its ability to provide accurate and targeted insights.  

This allows Muse to provide deeper insights and eliminates the need to repeatedly remind it of key details in your story.

Document search operates on a best-effort basis and may require multiple attempts for Muse to successfully access and reference your uploaded document. This behavior stems from limitations within the third-party API utilized for this feature. You can verify whether a document has been referenced by checking for the **Referenced Uploaded Documents** indicator at the bottom of Muse's response.

## Privacy and Retention Policy  

- **Privacy:** Uploaded files remain private and secure.  
- **Retention:**  
  - **Conversations:** Documents uploaded to conversations expire **7 days after your last interaction**.  
  - **Stories and Storyforms:** Documents uploaded to Stories or Storyforms are maintained for **30 days after your last interaction**.  
- **Data Usage:** Subtxt will **never train on your uploaded material** (there's no need to).  

After the retention period, documents are permanently deleted from our system.

## Muse and Storyform Context  

When uploading documents into a **Storyform** context, Muse uses that Storyform's structural framework to analyze your work. This enables more focused and contextualized analysis.  

Examples of how Muse can assist:  

> "Review my uploaded document against the current Storyform and list any inconsistencies."  

> "What areas of the story align with the Main Character Dynamics?"  

> "Do the Objective Story Throughline Storypoints appear as needed in this draft?"  

---

## Summary  

Subtxt makes it easy to upload and manage documents, enhancing your creative process with informed insights. Basic users can upload single documents to conversations, while Pro and Infinite users can leverage additional storage and the ability to upload files into Stories and Storyforms for broader narrative development.
