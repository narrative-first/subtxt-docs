In addition to the general creative capabilities, Muse offers several tools to help you organize and manage your conversations. These features allow you to customize, save, and revisit your discussions with Muse, making it easier to track your story’s development.

## The Conversation

Interacting with Muse is like diving into a stream-of-consciousness brainstorming session. The flow of ideas is organic and free-form, allowing you to explore various creative avenues without feeling restricted. Each conversation with Muse feels like an ongoing dialogue, evolving as new insights and directions emerge.

### Favoriting
You can highlight key moments in your conversation by marking them as favorites. This allows you to quickly return to important ideas, breakthroughs, or insights without needing to scroll through the entire conversation. It’s a handy way to keep track of critical points in your creative process.

### Change the Name of the Conversation
Organize your conversations by renaming them based on the story thread, theme, or brainstorming session. This feature helps you manage multiple projects or ideas and ensures that each conversation has a clear, relevant label for easy access.

### Download Conversations
You can download any conversation with Muse at any time (file downloaded into the Markdown format). This feature allows you to save a complete transcript of your discussions, giving you a permanent record of all your creative exchanges. You can review these later for further development or inspiration.

### Delete Conversations
If a conversation is no longer relevant or you want to keep your workspace tidy, you can delete it. This feature helps you declutter your workspace and keep your focus on the most productive and useful discussions.

## Moving Conversations

You can easily move a conversation from one Storyform into another, or even into a different story, simply by asking Muse.

> Can you move this conversation into the main story this Storyform belongs to?

## Importing Conversations

While you don’t need to worry about how long a conversation with Muse gets, if you ever want to use the information from one conversation in another, it’s a simple process. Just download the conversation as a file, create a new conversation, and upload that file into the new one. Muse will then have access to the previous conversation within the context of the current session, allowing you to seamlessly continue your work from where you left off.

## Why Muse Ends a Conversation
Occasionally, Pro users may receive the following notification:

> “Your last request to Muse failed because of subscription tier limitations. Consider upgrading your account or starting a new conversation. You will not be able to continue this conversation.”

This message indicates that you’ve hit the **context window limit** for Subtxt Muse. In this case, **the conversation has reached its limit**, and no further progress can be made in that session.

- **No Scaling Back**: Unlike excessive usage, this situation does not involve scaling back to the Standard model; it simply means that the conversation’s context window is full and cannot continue.
- **Work Is Finished**: Once this happens, you won’t be able to keep building on that specific conversation unless you take one of the following actions.

### Strategies for Handling End of Conversation Scenarios  

When you’ve hit the context window limit, there are a few options to continue working:  

1. **Upgrade to Subtxt/Dramatica Infinite**  
   - Subtxt/Dramatica Infinite allows for much longer conversations without hitting context window limits. Conversations can continue indefinitely without needing to worry about the limits of Muse’s context window.  

2. **Download and Re-Upload Your Conversation**  
   - You can download your conversation as a text file and start a new conversation by uploading that file into Muse. While this method won’t allow you to seamlessly pick up exactly where you left off, it does carry over key context from the previous session. This gives the new session a general understanding of what you were discussing, allowing you to maintain continuity in your narrative work. Some adjustments might be needed to guide it back on track.  

   - **Pro and Infinite Users:** If you’re on a Pro or Infinite account, you can also add the downloaded conversation to the list of documents in your current Story or Storyform. This approach works much better for maintaining context across sessions since Muse can refer to the document as needed while generating responses.  

3. **Switch to a Storytelling-Only Muse Persona**  
   - You can opt for a Muse Persona restricted to “Storytelling Only” (Subtxt/Dramatica Pro only). This reduces the extra layers of contextual information that Muse adds, allowing for a larger context window, similar to how a custom GPT operates. This way, you can extend the conversation without losing too much narrative depth.
