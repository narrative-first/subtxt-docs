# Muse Workspace

The **Muse Workspace** is your creative hub for asking questions, exploring ideas, and developing your story at any stage. Whether you’re in the early brainstorming phase or refining a detailed Storyform, Muse is there to guide and support your writing process.

## Ask Any Questions

You can interact with Muse as you would with a creative partner. Ask Muse about storytelling principles, get feedback on your ideas, or request suggestions for plot developments, character arcs, or thematic elements. Muse adapts to your needs and offers meaningful insights based on your story’s context.

> How can I keep the 2nd act engaging?

## Drawing Upon Examples

Muse is equipped to pull from a library of examples to inspire your process. If you’re unsure how to move forward with a scene, character arc, or thematic structure, you can ask Muse for examples from well-known stories. This feature can guide you in shaping your own narrative by demonstrating how similar situations have been handled in successful works.

> What are examples of stories with a Story Outcome of Failure and a Story Judgment of Good?

## Starting New Stories

In Muse, beginning a new story is as simple as opening a conversation. You can outline ideas, characters, or themes, and Muse will help shape these into a cohesive narrative. The flexibility in Muse allows you to explore without limitations, so whether you start with a single character idea or a thematic concept, Muse helps you organically develop your story.

> Let’s start a new story. Call it "The End of the Road"

## What's Next?

Feeling stuck or unsure how to move your story forward? Meet your creative coach: the **What's Next?** feature. Think of it as a personalized guide that adapts to your unique narrative journey.

Here’s how it works:

Muse checks in on your progress, reviewing the current conversation and assessing which Narrative Aspects you’ve already explored. It then identifies gaps and suggests actionable next steps to keep your story flowing effortlessly.

But that’s just the start. If you’re working within a Storyform context, **What's Next?** goes even deeper. It provides detailed, story-specific guidance designed to fill any narrative gaps—like having a story expert whisper the next right move in your ear. 🎯

Here's your revised documentation with the updates for "Story Navigator" and "Storyform Navigator," emphasizing the need to create and save Narrative Aspects before they appear:

## Navigating the Story Navigator and Storyform Navigator  

When working in the **Muse Workspace**, tapping on the **Story** or **Storyform** context takes you to the **Story Navigator** or **Storyform Navigator**, your central space for managing and exploring your narrative.  

### Story Navigator  

The **Story Navigator** helps you track and refine your story as it develops. Here, you can:  
- Update the **Title** of your Story.  
- Access a **Navigation List** that includes:  
  - **Narrative Aspects**: Saved story elements like Overviews, Storypoints, and Storybeats. *(Note: Until you create and save a Narrative Aspect—such as a Story Driver or Story Goal—you won’t see anything listed here.)*  
  - **Conversations**: Linked discussions that provide insights and help shape your story.  
  - **Documents**: Notes, drafts, or other materials related to this story.  

### Storyform Navigator  

The **Storyform Navigator** offers everything in the **Story Navigator**, plus:  
- A **Storyform Overview**, showing key structural elements of your narrative.  
- A **Develop** button, allowing you to seamlessly transition into the **Develop Workspace** for deeper refinement of your Storyform.

When you create a new Storyform, Muse will add _some_ foundational Narrative Asepcts—such as certain Story Drivers and Storypoints—based on your narrative structure. However, **not every Storypoint, Storybeat, or Dynamic will be present by default.** You’ll need to explicitly add the elements you need, as every author works differently and may not require access to every possible Storypoint.
::

The **Story Navigator** and **Storyform Navigator** ensure that all key aspects of your story are easily accessible, giving you full control over how your narrative takes shape. 

---

## Attaching Conversations to Stories or Storyforms  

Each conversation you have with Muse can be linked directly to the Story or Storyform you’re working on. This keeps your creative process organized and allows you to track how your ideas have evolved over time. By attaching conversations, you can revisit past insights and build upon earlier discussions.  

> Can you attach this conversation to my Storyform titled "The Road Form A"?  

When you attach a conversation to a Story or Storyform, Muse remembers the key elements of your Story or Storyform as you work. This includes major plot points, thematic ideas, and the characters you’ve developed. Specific details can be recalled in future sessions, so you never lose track of your narrative progress.  

For more information on how to work with conversations within Muse, please visit [Managing Conversations](/the-muse-workspace/managing-conversations). For more on what it means to attach a conversation to a Story or Storyform, please [Muse Context](/the-muse-workspace/muse-context).

## Saving and Updating Narrative Aspects

As you discuss ideas with Muse, you can save and update important story elements, such as Overviews, Storypoints, and Storybeats. This ensures that your creative progress is captured and stored, making it easy to revisit and refine your ideas as your story evolves.

::callout
---
icon: i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle
---
Muse does not automatically save your work into Narrative Aspects. To prevent unintended changes or excessive requests, you must explicitly ask Muse to save your progress.
::

> “Please save the above Main Character Progressions we just worked out to this Storyform.”

When saving Narrative Aspects, be sure to specify whether you want them applied to your **Story** or **Storyform**. While Muse will attempt to interpret your intent, being precise in your commands ensures a smoother experience.  

Developing a story with AI is not an exact science, and occasionally, Muse may misinterpret your request—especially if your instructions are vague or if you conflate concepts like **Story** and **Storyform**. If adapting to this AI-driven workflow feels frustrating, you may prefer working in the **Develop Workspace**, which offers a more traditional interface with buttons, forms, and structured text inputs.

::callout
---
icon: i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle
---
You cannot currently save or edit Narrative Aspects directly within the "pop-up" Muse in the Develop Workspace. This functionality is coming soon to Subtxt.
::

If this is a **new Narrative Aspect**, Muse will first confirm that you want to create the new item. If the aspect already exists within the context you specify, Muse will ask if you want to **overwrite** the existing information, **blend** in your new input with the old, or simply **cancel** the request.

::callout
---
icon: i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle
---
Muse does not allow you to delete items like Narrative Aspects like Storypoints or Storybeats directly, as it is designed to ensure data integrity. If you need to remove items, you must do so manually in either the **Develop Workspace** or in the Story or Storyform homebase in the **Muse Workspace.**
::

## Chat with Muse as if Talking to a Writing Partner

While you can ask Muse to explain certain parts of Dramatica theory or how to do something in Subtxt, you'll get more out of your experience if you dialogue with her and work out loud your thoughts in developing your story.

## Muse Knows Everything Published on Narrative First

Feel free to use Muse as a search interaction instead of the oft-requested search feature on Narrative First. Going forward, everything will be published to Muse instead of the blog.

## There Is No "Right" Way to Ask Muse Questions

The questions that work are the ones that come from you and your particular view of the world. Muse will be there to bounce ideas off of, but everyone's experience will be different, unique, and wonderful.

## The Importance of Specificity

When working on your story using Subtxt Muse, it's essential to be clear and specific about your intended focus. The AI is designed to respond to your input, so if you aren't explicit about what you want to work on, you may not get the desired outcome. It's important not to assume that any discrepancies are due to a problem with the application or memory management in the background. Instead, refine your inquiry to improve the AI's understanding of your request.


## Muse Extension Menu

The **Muse Extension Menu** is a handy pop-up located in the lower-left corner of the Muse input box. Simply look for the circle with three dots (•••), tap it, and you'll discover a range of powerful features to enhance your creative process. These include **Upload**, **Persona**, **Muse Mode**, and **Model Selection**. Each option offers a unique way to interact with Muse and your storytelling journey.

### Upload

With the **Upload** feature, you can integrate external documents—such as story drafts, outlines, or notes—directly into your creative workflow. Muse will analyze your uploaded material, providing feedback and suggestions to enhance or refine your work.

After uploading, Muse performs a quick moderation check to ensure the content aligns with the [Content Generation Policy](/resources/content-generation-policy). If the document passes, Muse generates a summary to capture its essence, which can later be referenced within your workspace.

For more information, check out [Uploading Documents](/the-muse-workspace/uploading-documents).

### Muse Personas

Muse can adopt different personas to suit your unique creative style, and you can access these options through the **Muse Persona** feature in the Extension Menu. Whether you need a casual brainstorming partner, a deep-dive theorist, or a focused narrative guide, Muse adjusts its tone and approach accordingly.

Each persona brings a fresh perspective to your story, helping you approach storytelling challenges in the way that best fits your current needs. Explore different personas to find the one that works for your specific process.

For further customization, check out more details about [Muse Personas](/the-muse-workspace/muse-personas).

### Muse Mode

Muse offers different modes to help you craft the perfect story experience. By default, Muse operates in **Muse Mode**, a balanced and adaptive setting that dynamically shifts between creative brainstorming, narrative theory, and storyforming to provide the most relevant guidance.

While Muse Mode provides a comprehensive, evolving experience, you can also switch to more focused modes for specific tasks:

- **Muse Mode**: The default setting that seamlessly adjusts between theory, storyforming, and creative ideation to deliver the right insights at the right time.
- **Theory Mode**: A deep dive into storytelling principles, providing detailed explanations to enhance your understanding of narrative theory.
- **Storyforming Mode**: A guided path to building and refining a **Storyform**, ensuring your story's structure and thematic argument are solid. *(Available to **Subtxt Infinite** subscribers only in **Q1 2025**.)*

::callout

icon: i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle

Full access to Muse's complete suite of tools—including uploading of documents, image generation, finalizing storyforms, and advanced narrative exploration—is exclusive to **Muse Mode**. Ensure you're in Muse Mode to unlock these powerful features. 
::

You can always quickly tell what Mode you are in by looking at the top center of the Muse Workspace.

### Intern Mode

Subtxt relies on an external API service (provided by OpenAI) to provide its narrative intelligence. Occasionally, this service may be temporarily unavailable or limited as it undergoes upgrades and maintenance. Think of it as if your "expert writing partner" is taking some time to recharge, so they can come back even better! When this happens, Subtxt smoothly rolls back Muse to "Intern Mode"—a simplified version that still supports essential functions, allowing you to continue your story development without constant interruptions.

In Intern Mode, while you might temporarily lose access to some advanced features—such as saving Narrative Aspects, referencing examples from various films, or checking your Storyform’s integrity in-depth—you’ll still have access to the core functionality needed to keep moving forward. It’s almost like working with an enthusiastic intern who may not yet have the depth of experience but can still help with foundational tasks.

When the API service is restored, Muse Mode will become available again, restoring the full feature set to support your creative process.

### Model Selection

With the **Model Selection** option, you can switch between different narrative models as you develop your story. This flexibility allows you to explore various storytelling frameworks, helping you adapt your story to different narrative theories or structures.

This feature is perfect for those looking to experiment with alternative story designs or trying to fit their work into a particular narrative framework.

For a detailed look into the different AI models available to Subtxt and Muse, check out [Focus and Flow](/narrative-intelligence/focus-and-flow).

## Building Storyforms

Once you’ve developed enough material in the Muse Workspace, you can begin crafting a Storyform. Muse helps guide you through this process by asking key questions about your story’s theme, characters, and plot structure. This step is crucial for transforming a general story idea into a structured narrative with a clear thematic argument.

> “Can you help me build a new Storyform for this story?”

### Narrative Theory Experts and Muse

For those with a deep understanding of a specific Narrative Model and/or Dramatica theory, you might occasionally notice that Muse will sometimes bring up structural elements that don’t align perfectly with these complex narrative conventions. If Muse presents conflicting Domains or Concerns, keep in mind that:

1.	**Reflection of Your Story Input**: Muse is designed to interpret and structure your story based on the details _you_ provide, even if they don’t entirely fit traditional specific Narrative Model patterns. If the story information you’ve given includes some inherent conflicts or mixed signals, Muse may set, for instance, the OS in Physical Processing (Physics in Dramatica) and the MC in Cognitive Processing (Psychology in Dramatica) as the best possible fit. This is an indication that there is something off about _your_ story, not an issue with Muse or Subtxt. You will need to adjust your thinking or storytelling to have those Domains fit into the "right" place.
2.	**Requesting a specific Narrative Model Structure**: If you recognize that Muse’s storyform isn’t aligned with a specific Narrative Model, you can ask it for a more rigorous check. The **Subtxt Focus** model is perfect for this scenario. If you are unable to specficially select the "Subtxt Focus" model (i.e., you're not a Pro or Infinite subscriber), specific prompts like “check the storyform,” “align the storyform,” or “check the integrity of the storyform” tell Muse to automatically engage this more focused and structured model, aimed at reinforcing structural consistency according to a specific Narrative Model principles.

With these targeted prompts, Muse can better align its suggestions to meet the needs of those more Subtxt Narrative and Dramatica-savvy users. You can read more about the Subtxt Focus model here: [Focus and Flow](/narrative-intelligence/focus-and-flow).

## Navigating Between Muse Workspace and Story Central

The **Muse Workspace** serves as your creative hub within Subtxt, where you can ask questions, explore ideas, and develop your story at any stage. Whether you're brainstorming or refining a detailed Storyform, Muse is designed to support your writing journey.

However, knowing how to navigate back to **Story Central**—the starting point for managing your stories—is essential for fluid movement between creative exploration and story management.

#### Global Muse Navigation

The button located in the upper-left corner of any Muse screen plays a key role in transitioning between Workspaces and Subtxt. Here's how it works based on your current context:

- **If you're actively working within a specific Story or Storyform**, clicking the quill icon will clear out the current story context and take you back to a fresh, clean Muse Workspace. This is useful when you want to continue brainstorming or developing without any previous story settings in place.

- **If you are already on an empty Muse Workspace** (i.e., you have no active Story or Storyform selected), the quill icon will be replaced with a classic "home" icon. Clicking it will return you to **Story Central**, where you can select or create a new story.

By understanding these navigation options, you can easily shift between your creative flow in the Muse Workspace and managing your stories in Story Central.
