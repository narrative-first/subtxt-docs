description: Stay oriented with Muse context for seamless story navigation

The **Muse Context** feature allows you to always see what context Muse is currently working in. Whether you’re focused on a **Story**, a **Storyform**, or a specific **Conversation**, the context is displayed along the bottom of Muse on desktop or in a dropdown menu on mobile. This helps you stay oriented and easily switch between different contexts as you work.

### Story Context
When Muse is in **Story Context**, it focuses on the larger, exploratory aspects of your narrative. This is the stage where you can freely explore themes, characters, and plot without being constrained by a formal structure.

### Storyform Context
In **Storyform Context**, Muse helps you work within a defined Storyform. Here, the thematic argument and structure of your narrative are already established, and Muse’s responses will guide you toward refining and developing this cohesive framework.

### Conversation Context
In **Conversation Context**, Muse is focused on the specific conversation you’re currently engaged in. You can dive deep into a particular aspect of your story, explore a character’s motivation, or brainstorm a plot twist. The conversation is linked to your story or Storyform, keeping your thoughts and creative exploration connected.

## Jumping Between Contexts
Clicking on any of the three contexts will take you back to that specific area:

- **Conversation Context**: Clicking this will take you back to the last message you exchanged in that conversation.
- **Story or Storyform Context**: Clicking on these will take you to the **Story Navigator** or **Storyform Navigator**, which serves as a central page for managing everything related to that particular story or Storyform.

## Starting New Conversations while In Context
If you’re working within a **Story or Storyform Context** and want to start a new conversation, click **New** at the top of the page. This will exit the current conversation but keep you in either the Story or Storyform Context, allowing you to start fresh without leaving your established structure.

Note that if you want to start anew with _no context_, you can tap the Muse button at the center top of the screen.

## Story and Storyform Navigator

The **Story Navigator** or **Storyform Navigator** are the central views for managing either your **Story** or **Storyform** within the Muse Workspace while remaining within context of the current conversation. This page is where you can adjust the title, navigate between key narrative elements, and see an organized list of all related story aspects.

### Breadcrumb Navigation
At the top of the Navigator page, you’ll see a **breadcrumb navigation** that shows you exactly where you are within the Muse Workspace. This helps you easily move between your story, Storyform, and conversations.

### Title Management
Below the breadcrumbs, you can adjust the title of your **Story** or **Storyform**. This flexibility allows you to rename your project as it evolves without losing track of your progress.

### Narrative Aspects
Underneath the title, you’ll find the key elements for the story:

- If you’re in **Story Context**, you’ll see sections like **Storyforms**, **Players**, **Storybeats**, and **Conversations**. These elements give you an overview of your story's structure and allow you to jump to specific parts of the creative process.

- If you’re in **Storyform Context**, the layout is similar, but it’s focused specifically on the current Storyform, allowing you to manage its thematic elements and structural components.

### Access to the Develop Workspace

In the **Storyform Navigator** view, you'll notice a **Develop** button. Clicking this button will open the **Develop Workspace** for that specific Storyform in a separate tab. The Develop Workspace is designed for more detailed and hands-on work, allowing you to dive deeper into refining and expanding your story's structure and elements.
