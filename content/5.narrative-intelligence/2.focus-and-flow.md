title: Focus and Flow
description: Tools for balancing intuitive creativity and deliberate storytelling refinement
---

Effortless inspiration one moment, deliberate refinement the next—this dynamic defines the creative process. In psychology, these modes are known as **System 1** (rapid, intuitive thinking) and **System 2** (deep, deliberate reasoning). Subtxt embraces this duality, providing tools to support both **Flow** and **Focus**, two essential perspectives for crafting compelling and meaningful stories.

#### **What Are Flow and Focus?**  

- **Flow**: A space for rapid, intuitive, and exploratory storytelling. Powered by GPT-4o from OpenAI, Flow fosters uninhibited creativity—perfect for brainstorming, freeform exploration, and capturing inspiration in the moment.  
- **Focus**: A mode for deep, deliberate refinement. Leveraging OpenAI’s advanced reasoning models, Focus is designed for intricate storytelling—ensuring logical cohesion, structural integrity, and narrative precision.  

This dual approach allows Subtxt to support both expansive idea generation and meticulous storytelling, adapting to your creative needs at every stage.

### **Why Muse Might Seem to Deviate from Narrative Structure**  

Muse default operates in **Subtxt Flow mode**, which is all about giving you creative freedom to play around with ideas and explore new possibilities. It’s a space for brainstorming without the pressure of locking into a rigid structure right away. In Flow, Muse may suggest Domains or narrative relationships that *appear* to be out of alignment (like the Main Character and Influence Character not sharing a Framing or Processing classification) because it prioritizes helping you explore your story ideas over enforcing structure rules.  

Behind the scenes, Flow mode may occasionally reach out to check thematic relationships **if it thinks it can do so without interrupting your creative process**. This is how Subtxt can lightly key things on track, even if the process feels more playful and less formal in Flow mode.

---

### **What Happens When You Switch to Focus Mode?**  

Once you're ready to nail down your story structure — ensuring the Domains, Throughlines, and Appreciations all follow the traditional Dramatica/Subtxt rules — you’ll naturally transition to **Subtxt Focus mode**. In Focus, the app will solidify the storyform and make sure everything aligns according to the theoretical concepts and structural rules. This currently isn’t a manual toggle; it’s triggered by the way you interact with Muse.  

For example, when you start asking Muse questions like:  
- *"Is the storyform working?"*  
- *"What’s the core inequity of this story?"*  
- *"What’s the throughline structure?"*  

That signals to Muse that you’re ready to move from exploration to precision. At that point, Muse will automatically switch to Focus mode in the background, check the structural integrity of your storyform and ensure everything lines up correctly.

### **In Summary: Flow vs. Focus**  

| **Flow**                  | **Focus**                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Creative exploration       | Structured storyforming    |
| Play around with ideas     | Nail down specific story points |
| May suggest "wrong" pairings | Ensures story aligns with Subtxt/Dramatica rules |
| Occasionally checks for thematic soundness| Confirms everything fits within the structure |

Think of Flow as a playground to *try things out*. Focus is where you say, *"Okay, let’s get serious and lock this down."*  

---

### **What You Can Do Right Now**  

If Muse suggested a Domain pairing that doesn’t seem right, don’t worry — just continue engaging with it. Ask questions like:  
- *"Is this alignment correct?"*  
- *"What should the MC's domain be?"*  

This will help Muse understand that you're ready to move into Focus mode.

### **Flow or Focus: Which Mode Fits Your Needs?**  
When in doubt, stick with **Flow Mode** for its versatility and ease, keeping your storytelling journey intuitive and creative. Switch to **Focus Mode** when you want to verify your storyform, need a deeper dive into narrative structure, or want to masterfully weave your entire narrative at once.
