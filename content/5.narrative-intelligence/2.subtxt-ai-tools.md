## **NarrativeSync**  

NarrativeSync helps you **generate and refine ideas while ensuring they remain in sync with your Storyform**. Whether you're working on a Storypoint, Storybeat, or Throughline, NarrativeSync ensures your creative process aligns with the deeper structure of your story.  

You'll find NarrativeSync beneath the **Storytelling** box in each section of your narrative. Represented by a digital brain icon, this tool generates ideas that fit seamlessly into your existing framework.  

### **Using NarrativeSync**  

1. **Syncing Your Ideas**  
   Click the NarrativeSync button to open the **Ideas drawer**. If the box is empty, NarrativeSync will generate suggestions based on the underlying **Storyform**, ensuring your ideas maintain structural integrity.  

2. **Customizing Inputs**  
   Add your own concepts, character names, or themes to refine the output. NarrativeSync incorporates your input while keeping your ideas aligned with the story’s narrative structure.  

3. **Iterating and Refining**  
   Use NarrativeSync multiple times to generate variations, helping you explore different ways of expressing a Storypoint or Storybeat while staying within the thematic framework.  

4. **Integrating Content**  
   Click **Add** to transfer generated content directly into the **Storytelling** box, ensuring your ideas stay connected to the larger narrative.  

5. **Exploring Alternatives**  
   Request multiple variations to explore different ways a Storypoint or Storybeat could be framed within the context of your Storyform.  

### **The NarrativeSync Factor**  

At the top right of the screen, the **NarrativeSync Factor slider** allows you to control the tool’s level of creative divergence:  
- Sliding toward **Most Probable** ensures ideas remain tightly structured and thematically grounded.  
- Sliding toward **Most Impossible** encourages more unconventional and boundary-pushing suggestions.  

The slider is also available in **Writings > Preferences**, where it influences all Narrative Agent outputs.  

## DevelopAI  

DevelopAI is your portal to working directly with Subtxt Muse for expert advice on developing and refining story elements. Located between the NarrativeSync button and the Storytelling box, DevelopAI enhances your storytelling with real-time, tailored support.  

### Using DevelopAI  

1. **Engaging Muse**  
   Select the DevelopAI button to activate Muse. The tool automatically gathers relevant context from your Storypoint or Storybeat.  

2. **Providing Context**  
   Add any additional details or questions to guide Muse’s response. You can ask for an explanation of your story element or dive into specific brainstorming.  

3. **Collaborating with Muse**  
   Engage in a productive, back-and-forth conversation. Muse can assist with explanations, suggestions, or live brainstorming for richer development.  

4. **Incorporating Suggestions**  
   Copy Muse’s response using the clipboard icon and paste it into your Storytelling box for seamless integration.  

Muse’s awareness of your entire Storyform allows for nuanced, informed advice that aligns with your overarching narrative structure.  

## ReviewAI  

ReviewAI provides quick, actionable feedback on your storytelling. It ensures your illustrations and content align with your narrative goals, helping you improve and move forward with confidence.  

### Using ReviewAI  

1. **Submitting Work**  
   After adding Storytelling to a Storypoint or Storybeat, click the **Review** button.  

2. **Receiving Feedback**  
   Muse will analyze your content and provide suggestions for improvement or confirm that your work is effective as is.  

3. **Improving Illustrations**  
   ReviewAI also helps refine illustrations by comparing them to a vast database of examples. Suggestions focus on enhancing thematic depth and narrative clarity.  
   
## SubtextAI  

SubtextAI is your gateway to understanding the deeper narrative principles behind your story. This tool, located next to your Writing Prompt, expands on the purpose of each Storypoint or Storybeat and connects it to the thematic framework of your story.  

### Features of SubtextAI  

- **Detailed Writing Prompts**  
  SubtextAI explains the role and purpose of specific story elements, helping you understand how they fit into the broader narrative structure.  

- **Examples from Storyforms**  
  It compares your work to similar films, novels, and television series to provide relatable examples and inspiration.  

- **Contextualized Insights**  
  SubtextAI links narrative theory to your specific story, offering explanations in direct relation to your content.  

DevelopAI is also accessible from SubtextAI, enabling you to explore and expand upon the detailed insights provided.  

## Cascading Context: How Subtxt AI Generates Content  

Subtxt AI tools rely on a **cascading fallback process** to create contextually accurate and thematically relevant content. This process ensures the AI uses the most detailed information available, falling back to broader sources when necessary.

### Hierarchy of Cascading Context  

1. **Storypoint Synopsis**  
   The most specific and detailed information available, located at the top of the Storypoints tab. This is the primary source for generation.  

2. **Throughline Perspective**  
   If no Storypoint Synopsis is available, Subtxt falls back to the description of the relevant Throughline.  

3. **Logline**  
   If neither of the above exists, the AI defaults to the overarching logline for guidance.  

### Example of Storybeat Generation  

When generating Storybeats, Subtxt will:  
- First, pull from the **Storypoint Synopsis** for precise guidance.  
- If unavailable, it will use the **Throughline Perspective** to maintain a narrower focus.  
- As a last resort, it will rely on the **Logline**, drawing from the broadest context of your story.  

This structured fallback ensures that Subtxt tools adapt to varying levels of story detail, always aiming to produce coherent and aligned outputs.  

## Behind the Scenes: The Power of Subtxt AI  

Subtxt AI combines cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of narrative principles.  

- **NarrativeSync** relies on existing Storytelling to provide informed, tailored suggestions. If no specific context is available, it uses a general narrative framework for guidance.  

- **Subtxt Muse** builds upon NarrativeSync with additional resources, including decades of narrative research, user insights, and successful story examples. Muse’s comprehensive capabilities enable it to deliver nuanced and context-rich responses.  

Whether you are brainstorming ideas, refining story elements, or seeking expert feedback, Subtxt AI tools adapt to your needs, providing creative support every step of the way.
