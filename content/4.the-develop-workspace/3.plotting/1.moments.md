title: Moments
description: Defining key storytelling units in your narrative
---

A **Moment** is a storytelling device unique to the Author. It could be a Chapter, a Scene, a Refusal of the Call, or a Fun and Games "moment." Whatever intuitive sequencing devices you use to put your story together—what you're used to using—use that to delineate various Moments.  

Once you have a bunch of Moments added to an Act, you then _weave_ the various Storybeats from all the different Throughlines into those different Moments.

## Why Moments?  

The most important moments of any complete story are those that reflect the Storybeats of a meaningful structure. Whether considered scenes, sequences, fun and games, story blocks, or the crossing of thresholds, these concepts of storytelling hold the meaning in place—making them convenient constructs for Authors when writing their stories.  

The more Storybeats you have in a Moment, the more _important_ it will appear thematically to your reader or viewer.  

**Moments** are represented in Subtxt as cards labeled "Untitled" by default. You can customize the name of your Moment by clicking on the word "Untitled" and entering a title that reflects its role in your story.  

Moments in Subtxt bridge the gap between deep thematic structure and the functional outline of a treatment. This is where the Author weaves the threads of the individual Throughlines into distinct "moments" that inspire specific instances of storytelling.

Contrary to popular belief, Moments are _not_ story structure. The “Dark Night of the Soul,” “All is Lost,” “Belly of the Whale,” and “Refusal of the Call” are Moments of *storytelling*, not structure. These terms can be swapped or re-ordered without altering the narrative's meaning. Subtxt provides templates for these Moments but emphasizes their role as storytelling tools, not structural absolutes.

## Confining Storybeats to a Specific Transit  

While Authors of complete stories have freedom in weaving Moments, Subtxt enforces one rule: **only the Storybeats of a single Transit in time can be woven together.**  

Each Transit (often analogous to "Acts") sets and explores conflict within a specific context. For example:  
- The Objective Story Throughline might explore conflict in Doing during the First Transit.  
- The Main Character Throughline might focus on personal conflict tied to the Past.  

By isolating the type of context in each Transit, the narrative examines and exhausts its options for resolving conflict, before moving on to another context.  

In Subtxt, when you click on a specific Transit under Moments, you will only see the relevant Transits, Progressions, and Events developed for that Transit across the Four Throughlines.

## Differences Between Storybeats and Moments  

To clarify the distinction between **Storybeats** and **Moments**, let’s explore their roles in your narrative and how they work together within Subtxt.  

### Storybeats vs. Moments  

- **Storybeats** represent the **temporal progression of events** within your story. They track how the plot unfolds over time, marking key transitions and meaningful moments within a single Throughline.  
- **Moments**, on the other hand, are **higher-level narrative structures** that encompass multiple Storybeats, often integrating Storybeats from different Throughlines.  

A single **Moment** can consist of:  
- Four **Transits**,  
- Each Transit transitioning through **four Progressions**,  
- Each Progression progressing through **four Events**.  

Moments serve as an opportunity for the Author to weave Storybeats together into a more unified and cohesive storytelling tapestry.  

---

### Why There Might Be Confusion  

When asking tools like Muse to generate story content, it’s important to understand this distinction. If you request a Storybeat that integrates different Throughlines, Muse might interpret your request as seeking a **Moment**—since Moments naturally combine Storybeats across multiple Throughlines.  

This can sometimes lead to Muse providing suggestions that appear inconsistent with your intended Progressions. Rather than focusing on an individual Storybeat, it may try to create a higher-level narrative structure that feels more like a Moment.

By recognizing the distinction between **Storybeats** and **Moments**—and clearly communicating your intent—you can more effectively integrate cohesive narrative elements and maintain consistency within your story.

## Managing Moments  

### Adding Moments to Your Story  

When you first click into a Transit, your story will not have any Moments identified yet.  

To add a Moment and begin weaving your Storybeats:  
- Click the blue **Add** button at the top of the screen.  

You can add as many Moments as you need. Subtxt will organize and number them within your story automatically.  

### Labeling a Moment  

When labeling Moments, use a storytelling system that resonates with you. Moments can align with scenes, sequences, or paradigms like the _Save the Cat!_ "Beat Sheet." Subtxt's flexibility allows you to tailor Moments to fit any storytelling framework.  

### Editing the Setting for a Moment  

Each Moment in your story has a Setting that you can update to provide additional context. The Setting can include details about the location, world, and characters involved—any information that enhances the narrative and supports the Storybeats within the Moment.  

Updating the Setting is especially important for Pro/Infinite subscribers who want to take full advantage of Subtxt’s Weaving Agents. The Agents use the Setting to guide the progression of Beats in the Moment, ensuring a richer and more immersive storytelling experience. By refining the Setting, you allow the Weaving Agents to generate more accurate and meaningful content for your story.

### The Storybeat Basement  

Storybeats that are not yet assigned to a Moment reside in the **Storybeat Basement** at the bottom of a specific Transit.  

Storybeats in the Basement will _not_ appear in your final Treatment. While some Storybeats might have been crucial during development, you may decide they are unnecessary for the final story.  

::callout

icon: i-heroicons-light-bulb

Ensure at least one Storybeat of a Throughline exists at the Transit level, whether as a single Transit, four Progressions, or 16 Events. This guarantees that the Thematic Issue tied to the Transit is woven into your Moments.

To explore the process of weaving Transits, Progressions, and Events in depth, refer to the article [Traversing the Storybeats of a Complete Story](https://narrativefirst.com/articles/traversing-the-storybeats-of-a-complete-story).

### Adding Storybeats to Moments  

To attach a Storybeat to a Moment:  
1. Drag the Storybeat from the Basement and drop it onto the desired Moment.  
2. Alternatively, use the **Add Storybeat** button (a folder icon with a plus sign) and select the Moment.  

Subtxt locks the Storybeat to that Moment, adding thematic meaning to your story. If needed, you can move the Storybeat between Moments or return it to the Basement.  

---

## Interacting with Storybeats  

- Use the **Downstairs** button to quickly return a Storybeat to the Basement.  
- To reference a Storybeat within its Throughline, click the **Jump to Throughline** button.  
- Rearrange Storybeats or Moments using the up/down arrows, which works particularly well on mobile devices.  

Subtxt prevents you from moving Storybeats or Moments outside of permissible boundaries, ensuring consistency in your story structure.

Here's the rewritten version with a more natural flow, starting with the introduction to weaving storybeats, presenting the three core actions upfront, and then transitioning into the Pro/Infinite features:

---

### Weaving Storybeats

There are no strict rules for weaving Storybeats across Throughlines—you can mix and match them as needed to fit your creative vision. A Main Character Transit might precede an Objective Story Progression, followed by Events from multiple Throughlines. The challenge for many writers using Subtxt is figuring out how to sequence these beats effectively. This is often where they get stuck—or even give up.

Now, with AI, that struggle is a thing of the past. Instead of manually piecing beats together, you can simply add the Storybeats you believe belong in a Moment, and let Subtxt intelligently weave them into a cohesive flow.

### Moment Actions: Setting, Imperatives, Synopsis, and Weave

Every Moment in Subtxt provides four key actions to help structure your story:

- **Setting**: Define the location, characters, and any other environmental elements that establish the "world" of the Moment. These details help ground the narrative and provide a backdrop for the unfolding events.
- **Imperatives**: List the events or dialogues that **must** occur within the Moment. When generating Synopses or weaving Storybeats (for Pro and Infinite subscribers), Subtxt will prioritize these Imperatives as determinative events that must happen in the telling of the Moment.
- **Synopsis**: Generates a structured summary of the ordered Storybeats. If no synopsis exists yet, you can create one as long as there are Storybeats attached to the Moment. This feature is available to all Subtxt subscribers, regardless of tier.
- **Weave (Pro/Infinite Only)**: Uses advanced AI to determine the most effective sequence for the Storybeats, ensuring logical progression, emotional impact, and narrative momentum.

This AI-driven weaving is so sophisticated that if the Storybeats within a Moment don’t naturally connect, Subtxt will automatically cluster them into "mini" Moments. You won’t see an explicit marker for this, but you’ll notice that Storybeats from similar Throughlines are grouped in a way that builds toward a natural thematic progression. This is why we call them Moments—not Scenes—because they function on a broader, more conceptual level.

### Narrative Tasks & Weaving (Pro & Infinite Subscribers)

Pro and Infinite subscribers gain access to Subtxt's Narrative Tasks, which automate the weaving process. Simply add all the Storybeats you want to see play out—regardless of order—and tap **Weave**. After confirming, Subtxt will analyze the Moment, its setting, and all the included beats to determine the best sequence, maintaining Throughline integrity while introducing logical and emotional flow (with a touch of surprise).

Once processing is complete, you'll receive an email notification. Returning to Subtxt, you’ll find a newly generated **Synopsis**, which serves as an overview of the structured narrative. While this synopsis isn’t editable, it provides a clear reference for how the Storybeats have been arranged.

You can then review the ordered Storybeats and make any necessary adjustments. If you modify the sequence, be sure to re-generate the Synopsis to reflect the updated order. Otherwise, you’re ready to move on to the next Moment and continue shaping your story.

With Subtxt’s Narrative Tasks, structuring isn’t something you have to wrestle with anymore. Focus on capturing the right Storybeats, and let Subtxt take care of the rest.

## Monitoring the Sequence of Storybeats  

While weaving Storybeats, it’s important to respect their original sequence within a Throughline to maintain your story's meaning.  

- **Subtxt highlights out-of-sequence Storybeats in red.**  
  For example, if Objective Story Event 20 is placed before Objective Story Event 19, Subtxt will flag this as out-of-sequence.  

To correct the issue, adjust the position of the Storybeat until it is no longer highlighted.  

---

## Summarizing Moments  

Subtxt can help summarize Moments by generating a title based on their associated Storybeats. Click on the Moments icon in the top-left corner of a card to use this feature.  

---

## Transitioning from Moments to Treatment  

Once you’ve woven your Storybeats, click on the **Treatment** tab in the Writing section to see the resulting narrative. Your treatment will reflect key, _purposeful_ Moments tied directly to your story’s thematic Premise.

## Weaving the Moments of a Television Series  

The structure of a television series or episode is no different from that of a screenplay or novel. For an example of weaving Storybeats in an episode, refer to the article [The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Season One Pilot) Second Act Treatment](https://narrativefirst.com/articles/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-one-pilot-second-act-treatment).
