description: Streamline your story assembly process
---

Plotting Agents are designed to save you a ton of time when it comes to putting together your final treatment. Based in large part around popular paradigms of story _sequencing_, these Agents will do the heavy lifting of organizing all the work you've done so far in Subtxt.

## Subtxt and Templates of Storytelling

Subtxt is definitively **objective**, unlike other more popular story structure "templates" which are _subjective_ interpretations of story structure. 

By subjective, we mean Audience-based and experiential. By objective, we mean Author-based and intentional. You can layer any arrangement of sequences from a subjectively-biased story structure template onto a Storyform developed in Subtxt, and the story's intent remains the same.

You can see this at work by simply selecting one of the Plotting Agents and viewing the results of the completed outline. While the superficial boundaries of "Chapter" and "Sequence" may have changed, the underlying meaning of the story remains the same. 

Select another template and again, evaluate the results: same story, different wrapping.

The dividing lines between the "moments" of a story (Sequences, Scenes, Chapters, etc.) are arbitrary and ultimately meaningless when it comes to a story's inherent resonance. You can take any narrative developed with Subtxt (Four Throughlines) and filter it through any of these templates and the impact of your story will remain the same in every case.

## Filtering Meaning through a Template

When you choose to plot with a template, Subtxt does not alter the storytelling work you have already done. Instead, the feature creates Moments in each Act that match the chosen template and weaves your existing work into those Moments.

For instance, in the 2000s Story Structure template, the Turning Point correlates with the middle (third) Story Driver. If that Driver exists, Subtxt creates a Moment titled "Turning Point" and attaches the Story Driver to that Moment.

Similarly, the "Subplot Introduction" found in the 2000s Story Structure template, which attempts to describe the Relationship Story Throughline, is plotted before the final Story Driver of Act One in Subtxt to maintain narrative integrity.

The template also has sequences such as "Adventures and Trials" that are less clearly defined. In these cases, Subtxt creates a Moment with the corresponding title and weaves Transits and Progressions into a potential order within that Moment. You, as the Author, can then rearrange these Storybeats as needed.

## A Treatment for Everyone Else

This feature is designed to help you present your narrative in a familiar and digestible pattern to your agent, editor, writing group, or friends who might not understand the intricacies of a Storyform. It allows you to focus more on what truly matters: writing your story.

## The More Detail, the Better

Many of our Plotting Agents, particularly the Key Moments Agent, thrive on detailed story development. These agents are designed to work with in-depth breakdowns of your story's progression. If you've segmented your Overall Story (OS) Transits into detailed Progressions, you're in for a treat! This level of detail enables the Plotting Agents to generate all 28 Key Moments, adding depth and complexity to your narrative.

However, if your story is yet to be broken down into these Progressions, don't worry. Our system is designed to adapt. While not every Key Moment may be filled out in such cases, this doesn't detract from the overall completeness of your story. In fact, storytelling is an art that doesn't strictly adhere to a set formula. The absence of certain Moments doesn't imply an incomplete story. It's simply a different approach to narrative construction.

Remember, these Moments and the sequencing provided by the Plotting Agents are not definitive markers of a complete story. They are tools to enhance and explore the dimensions of your narrative.

## Storytelling Templates

Story Structure templates are of their time and exist usually as the work of one individual. Their personal "subjective" appreciation of structure matches that of any Audience member--they just happened to gain more attention for the approachability of their work.

The storytelling templates available to you in Subtxt are:

- The 28 Key Moments
- 2010s Story Structure
- 2000s Story Structure
- 1990s Story Structure
- 1980s Story Structure
- University-style Story Structure
- Sequenced Approach to Novel Structure

These Plotting Agents are designed to enhance your story, particularly when detailed Progressions are used. While our Key Moments agent optimally utilizes these detailed breakdowns to generate all 28 Key Moments, it's not essential that you have all of these Progressions illustrated for a complete story. Whether your narrative is fully detailed or more broadly sketched, the Plotting Agents adapt to your storytelling style, ensuring richness and depth without being restrictive.

## The 28 Key Moments of a Complete Story

Here, you'll find a Subtxt-specific approach to storytelling sequencing that marries logic and emotion, helping you develop all Four Throughlines of your story in a balanced and evocative way. Unlike many plotting templates that focus only on plot progression or character arcs, the 28 Key Moments approach is holistic, embracing the multifaceted nature of storytelling.

**The 28 Key Moments of a Complete Story** are part of a comprehensive template that outlines the pivotal moments in a compelling narrative. This sequence provides a roadmap for authors, guiding them through the intricate process of storytelling.

From the initial catalyst that sparks the story into motion, through escalating tensions, personal challenges, and game-changing events, to the final revelations and resolutions, each moment serves a crucial role in the narrative's progression.

This journey is not just about the events that unfold, but also about the characters' personal growth, their relationships, and the emotional undercurrents that drive them. This template serves as a beacon, illuminating the path to creating a story that is both logically consistent and emotionally compelling.

### Aligning 28 Key Moments with Dramatica Theory 

Subtxt's 28 Key Moments of a Complete Story do not correspond with the 28 Signposts and Journeys of Dramatica, and therefore are not equal in how they divide up a story (even though they both divide a story up into 28 parts).

In Dramatica, you're supposed to look at a story in terms of Signposts OR Journeys, you're not really supposed to look at them both at the same time as they're appreciating a story from two separate points-of-view (like the difference between seeing light as either a particle or a wave). The idea of 28 sequences as a combination of 4 Signposts and 7 Journeys is a misunderstanding of the theory.

In Subtxt, the 28 Moments are a strict interpretation of only Transits (what Dramatica refers to as Signposts) to the exclusion of Journeys. They are a combination of the 16 Progressions in the OS and the 12 Transits in the other three Throughlines.

## Plotting with Popular Story Structure Templates

Popular Story Structures are trendy and tend to shift every decade, so we've organized them accordingly. Popularity is typically a sign of generality and convenience--and the list below of storytelling paradigms are no exception. Information on the various Moments found within each template can be found elsewhere. We've also included some structures that exist outside of these trends to provide a comprehensive toolkit for writers.

What’s important to understand here is that these structures are essentially interchangeable; you can use any one of them, swap it out with another, and your story's meaning to the audience will remain the same. With Subtxt, however, the approach is different. Swap out one Storypoint or Storybeat, and all the others will need to shift to align with your new thematic focus.

Each story structure marks stages of growth using different terminology, making them ultimately transferable and meaningful to those who find value in organizing their stories this way. There are countless ways to frame a narrative through these subjectively-biased templates. If you don't see your favorite template here, you can always ask Muse to organize your Storybeats by copying and pasting your preferred structure, and Muse will do the rest of the work.
