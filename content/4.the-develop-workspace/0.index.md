In the **Develop Workspace**, you can guide your story through four key stages of development: **Forming**, **Illustrating**, **Plotting**, and **Writing**. While the Subtxt/Dramatica platform is not built as a rigid, step-by-step process—since the structure of a narrative is relational—these stages are designed to flow in a top-down manner within the workspace, offering you a clear path from idea to execution.

Each stage is crafted to guide you smoothly through the storytelling process, helping you stay organized while maintaining the creative flexibility that Subtxt offers.

## Introducing the "Pop-Up" Muse  

Throughout the Develop Workspace, you'll have access to a "pop-up" Muse—your creative assistant that’s always available when inspiration strikes. Unlike the free-flowing **Muse Workspace**, the "pop-up" Muse always operates within the context of your current Storyform. This means it keeps the Storyform in "memory" while answering your questions and assisting with creative exploration.  

The "pop-up" Muse is the perfect place to:  

- Ask questions about **Storypoints** or **Storybeats** you might not fully understand.  
- Follow up on creative brainstorming or narrative ideas you've been working through.  

Whether you're stuck on a particular structural element or looking for inspiration to enhance a scene, the "pop-up" Muse can provide quick, contextual support to keep you moving forward.

Unlike the Muse in the **Muse Workspace**, the "pop-up" Muse does not currently allow you to update, save, or edit Narrative Aspects directly to your Storyform. For now, any ideas or insights generated must be manually transferred using the clipboard button (copy/paste) into your Storyform for later retrieval. This is a temporary limitation, and we’re actively working on a future update to bring the same full functionality you enjoy in the Muse Workspace to the "pop-up" Muse.

  This is where your story begins. In this stage, you'll transform your initial ideas into the foundation of your narrative by developing the Four Throughlines. This includes defining the Beginning and the End of your story, considering the emotional arcs of your characters, and finalizing the core elements of your Storyform. Forming sets the groundwork, bringing clarity to your narrative's purpose and direction.

  Once you have your core structure in place, you'll move to Illustrating, where you start fleshing out the details. This stage is focused on developing Storypoints and Storybeats. Here, you'll add nuance and depth to your story, shaping the narrative by visualizing key moments and interactions that give your story life.

  In the Plotting stage, all the Storypoints and Storybeats come together. This is where you start weaving the individual threads into a cohesive narrative flow. You'll structure and organize your ideas into a logical sequence, aligning them with your overall Storyform to ensure your story progresses naturally and effectively.

  The final stage is Writing, where you prepare your story for export. This is the stage for making final checks and ensuring everything is in place. Once you've reviewed your narrative structure, you can download the completed outline for use in your preferred writing application, setting you up for the drafting phase.
