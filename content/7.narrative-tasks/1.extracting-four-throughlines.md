The Extract Four Throughlines Task is a powerful tool designed to help you clarify and expand your story's narrative structure. This feature can be found on the **Overviews tab** within the **Develop Workspace**. By leveraging your input in the **Genre Dynamics** and **Logline** sections, this Narrative Task will extract the Four Throughlines of your story and guide you toward a complete and meaningful narrative framework.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Requirements**: Begin by writing something in either or both the **Genre Dynamics** and **Logline** sections within the Overviews.
2. **Activation**: Once you've entered sufficient information, activate the Task by selecting the "Generate Four Throughlines" button. The Subtxt/Dramatica platform will begin to extract the Four Throughlines.
3. **Extraction Process**: The platform will analyze your input and generate four distinct Perspectives, one for each Throughline:
   - **Objective Story Throughline**
   - **Main Character Throughline**
   - **Influence Character Throughline**
   - **Relationship Story Throughline**
   - Additionally, the Task will create **Objective Story Players** for both the Main Character and Influence Character, assigning them roles and placing them within the newly generated Objective Story Throughline Perspective.
4. **Notification**: When the extraction process is complete, the platform will notify you via email. Alternatively, you can watch the process unfold on the **Building page** in real-time.

### Example Output

**Extracted Four Throughlines**

- **Objective Story Throughline**: A determined Union spy undertakes a perilous journey deep into Confederate territory to uncover a secret conspiracy that could turn the tide of the Civil War. Along the way, he must outsmart double agents and forge uneasy alliances, all while racing against time to prevent catastrophe.
- **Main Character Throughline**: Having lost his wife in a raid early in the war, Jacob Turner harbors a simmering guilt over leaving his family unprotected. This emotional burden drives his fierce commitment to the Union cause, yet it also clouds his judgment when confronted with morally gray choices.
- **Influence Character Throughline**: Believing her homeland’s sovereignty is at stake, Rose Turner views the war as a desperate fight for independence. Her unwavering conviction that both sides commit grave injustices challenges Jacob’s black-and-white outlook on loyalty, forcing him to reckon with the human cost of an all-consuming conflict.
- **Relationship Story Throughline**: (father/daughter) Long separated and each shaped by opposing allegiances, their familial bond creates an undercurrent of love and regret. Even as they clash over the war's purpose, father and daughter struggle to protect one another. This turbulent dynamic softens over time, as they confront the pain of their past and rediscover a fragile sense of hope in each other.

## Surface the Subtext

Once you’ve reviewed and refined the Four Throughlines, scroll back to the top of the Overview to **surface the subtext** you’ve just created into a **Blended Overview**. This expanded Overview presents a holistic view of your story’s complex narrative structure, blending the perspectives of the Four Throughlines into a unified narrative.

**Blended Throughlines Overview**

> In the shadow of the Civil War’s chaos, Union spy Jacob Turner embarks on a dangerous mission deep into Confederate territory to uncover a deadly conspiracy that could alter the course of the conflict. Haunted by the loss of his wife in a brutal raid and burdened by guilt for failing to protect his family, Jacob’s relentless pursuit of justice often blinds him to the moral complexities of his actions. His journey takes an unexpected turn when he crosses paths with his estranged daughter, Rose, a fierce Confederate sympathizer who believes the war is a fight for her homeland’s survival. Their reunion is fraught with tension, as their opposing loyalties clash and old wounds resurface. Yet, as they navigate a web of double agents, betrayals, and uneasy alliances, their shared grief and unspoken love force them to confront the human cost of their convictions. Together, they must decide whether to let the war tear them apart once more or to forge a fragile bond in the face of an impending catastrophe that threatens both their lives and the future of the nation.

### Important Note on Overviews

The Overviews are **just for you, the Author**. The Subtxt/Dramatica platform does not use Overviews  throughout the rest of the system—they’re simply a way for authors and storytellers to help better understand their story. If you want your changes to be reflected throughout the app, always make adjustments to the components below the Overview.

## Regenerating the Four Throughlines

If you need to start over, you can always **Regenerate the Four Throughlines**. This action will wipe out the current Four Throughlines and allow you to begin the extraction process again from scratch. To do this:

1. Navigate to the **Four Throughlines tab**
2. Access the **Narrative Tasks** at the top of the page
3. Select the option to regenerate the Four Throughlines

## Deeper Illustration of Each Throughline

In addition to generating the Four Throughlines, the Subtxt/Dramatica platform will also illustrate each Throughline in greater depth by creating **Domain Storypoints** for each Throughline. These detailed illustrations can be found in their respective tabs within the **Illustrating** section, assigned to the corresponding Perspective generated by the Extract Four Throughlines Task.

These illustrations provide additional context and help you further develop your narrative by breaking down each Throughline into more specific elements.
