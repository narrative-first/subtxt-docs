## Global and Perspective-Based Narrative Tasks  

### **Global Narrative Tasks**  

Global Narrative Tasks are accessible directly from the **Forming**, **Illustrating**, and **Plotting** tabs in the main workspace. These agents function independently of any set Perspective, allowing you to make sweeping, story-wide changes without additional setup.  

### **Perspective-Based Narrative Tasks**  

Tasks that require a Perspective to be set are available within specific sections of the Develop Workspace. You can access them by tapping the **Narrative Tasks** button (three-line icon) in the upper-right corner of the individual section pages. These agents generate results tailored to the selected Throughline, ensuring precise and contextually relevant output.

## Accessing Narrative Tasks  

To access Narrative Tasks, navigate to the **Develop Workspace**. Depending on the type of Task you need:  
- Use **Global Tasks** directly within the **Forming**, **Illustrating**, or **Plotting** tabs.  
- For Perspective-based Tasks, open the **Narrative Tasks** menu in the upper-right corner of the section page.  

Each task sent to the **Subtxt/Dramatica render farm** undergoes multiple passes through advanced AI models, ensuring that every element of your story is structured effectively and aligns with your vision.

## Task Progress Bar  

The **Task Progress** bar, accessible through the Narrative Tasks dropdown menu, helps you visualize your progress. Toggle it on or off to stay on track with key story development steps.

## Available Narrative Tasks  

### **Global Narrative Tasks**  

Accessible on the main section tabs:  
- **Generate Four Throughlines**: Automatically define the Objective Story, Main Character, Influence Character, and Relationship Story Throughlines.  
- **Generate Plot & Players**: Quickly build plot and characters in one step, combining structural and motivational elements.  

### **Perspective-Based Narrative Tasks**  

Accessible via the Narrative Tasks menu within individual section pages:  

#### **Forming Section**  

- **Generate Players**: Define key characters, such as the Protagonist and Antagonist, focusing on their **Motivations** and **Roles**.  
- **Generate Media Cues**: Bring your Players to life with visual and auditory descriptions for a [**dynamic cast experience**](/narrative-aspects/players#generating-media-cues).  

#### **Illustrating Section**  

- **Generate Storybeats**: Craft a sequence of Storybeats, aligning story structure with thematic and emotional goals.  

#### **Plotting Section**  

- **Generate Plot**: Build a cohesive plot structure informed by your selected Perspective.  
- **Generate Character Arcs**: Create detailed character arcs for the Main or Influence Character.

## Setting Perspectives: A Critical Step  

For Perspective-based Tasks, setting a **Perspective** is essential. Without a Perspective, the tasks cannot activate, as this step provides context and direction for the story creation process.
