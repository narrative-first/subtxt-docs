title: Generating Storybeats
description: Creating thematic beats for your story effortlessly
---

The **Generating Storybeats** Task is designed to intelligently craft the major thematic beats for your story across the Four Throughlines. By analyzing the key structural elements and perspectives you’ve set, Subtxt produces a complete sequence of Story Drivers and transitions, bridging the gap between abstract storytelling concepts and concrete, compelling scenes.  

This feature offers a streamlined way to kickstart or refine your story's structure while providing aligned storytelling suggestions tailored to your specific story.  

## What Does Subtxt/Dramatica Generate for the OS Throughline?   

Subtxt/Dramatica starts by analyzing the foundational elements of your story, such as the Goal, Consequence, Story Drivers, and key Outcome, before using its advanced intuition to craft the Storybeats. These beats form the backbone of your narrative, providing both structure and narrative flow. 

The platform doesn’t just focus on overall concepts—it also integrates the unique motivations, intentions, and roles of your story’s Players. For each Perspective, Subtxt/Dramatica uses the information you’ve defined about the Protagonist, Antagonist, or other assigned Players to intuitively shape the story’s trajectory, ensuring every beat feels specific and tailored to your story world.  

Once you choose a Perspective to generate from, Subtxt/Dramatica will look at:

**Dopamine Aligned narratives**:
- **Goal** and **Consequence**
- **Initial** and **Concluding Story Drivers**
- **Story Outcome**
- all **Players** assigned to that Perspective

**Serotonin Aligned narratives**:
- **Intention** and **Overwhelm**
- **Midpoint** and **Concluding Story Drivers**
- **Story Outcome**
- all **Players** assigned to that Perspective

Based on this supporting information, Subtxt's Narrative Tasks will then generate:

- the five major **Story Drivers** that define turning points in your story
- the four thematic **Objective Story Transits** that operate between the Drivers  
- **Aligned Illustrations** that transform abstract concepts into rich, concrete storytelling moments.  

The result is a comprehensive, theme-driven structure designed to inspire and guide your creative process.  

## Perspective Selection  

When generating Storybeats, Subtxt/Dramatica works with any Players assigned to the selected Perspective, such as the **Protagonist**, **Antagonist**, or other characters. It considers the motivations, intentions, and roles you’ve already defined for these Players, using them to guide its storytelling intuition. This ensures that each Storybeat aligns with the thematic framework **and** the emotional truth of your characters.  

For example:  
- If your Protagonist is driven by a desire to **restore balance**, the platform ensures that this motivation influences how the Initial Driver and subsequent Storybeats unfold.  

Subtxt/Dramatica’s intuitive approach means that the generated beats are uniquely suited to your story's thematic goals and character dynamics.
