When a story incorporates multiple Storyforms, it often requires careful consideration of screen time or page length to ensure each Storyform is fully realized. Each Storyform represents a complete narrative argument, so balancing their development is essential to maintain clarity and engagement for the audience. 

### Questions to Consider

To determine whether your story involves multiple Storyforms or just one, ask:

1. **Are all characters exploring the same thematic issues and narrative questions?**
   - If yes, it’s likely a single Storyform handed off between different sets of characters. In this case:
     - Find the overarching Storyform that resonates with you.
     - Create different **Perspectives** for each group of characters, giving them their own “take” on the Objective Story Throughline.
     - One couple or pair will likely stand out as the **Main Character (MC)** and **Influence Character (IC)**—or you could hand off these roles as the story progresses.

2. **Are the thematic explorations distinct enough to warrant separate Storyforms?**
   - If yes, then you’re working with multiple Storyforms within a single story. Here, the challenge is to structure them cohesively while managing the amount of information you present to the audience.

### Screen Time and Complexity

Multiple Storyforms demand more time to develop fully, which is why films with layered narratives often run longer. You’ll notice that examples of multiple Storyform films typically approach or exceed two hours:

- **The Empire Strikes Back**: 124 minutes  
- **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: 115 minutes  
- **As Good As It Gets**: 139 minutes  
- **Jerry Maguire**: 138 minutes  
- **Barbie**: 114 minutes  
- **RRR**: 182 minutes  

Meanwhile, single-Storyform films tend to run shorter, as they focus on one cohesive thematic argument:

- **Casablanca**: 102 minutes  
- **Top Gun**: 110 minutes  
- **The Lion King**: 88 minutes  
- **The Terminator**: 107 minutes  
- **Whale Rider**: 101 minutes  

### Notable Exceptions and Hand-offs

Some films that approach the 120-minute mark manage complexity through “hand-offs” between perspectives. For example:

- **The Incredibles**: 114 minutes, with a hand-off of MC/OC Perspectives that increases the narrative complexity.  
- **The Lion King**: At 88 minutes, its claim as a complete Storyform is debatable, suggesting some thematic threads may not fully resolve.
