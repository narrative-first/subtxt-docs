title: Narrative Alignment
description: Exploring narrative influence through Internal Processing styles in storytelling
---

In Subtxt, **Narrative Alignment** is the practical application of the broader narrative concept of **Cognitive Alignment**. While Cognitive Alignment explores how the mind processes conflict through reward-based (Dopamine) or relational-based (Serotonin) cognitive styles, Narrative Alignment allows writers to embody the same process within the structure of their narrative.  

Every Storyform in Subtxt is assigned a **Narrative Alignment**, either **Dopamine** or **Serotonin**, which tailors the story’s structure, terminology, and tools to match the chosen cognitive style.  

Examples of **Dopamine Alignment** narratives:
- _Star Wars_
- _Top Gun_
- _Casablanca_

Examples of **Serotonin Alignment** narratives:
- _Forrest Gump_
- _Dances with Wolves_
- _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_

### Cognitive Alignment: The Foundation  

The concept of **Narrative Alignment** builds on Subtxt's evolution of the Dramatica theory's original concept of **Mental Sex**, shifting away from metaphorical explanations toward a neuroscience-based understanding. This ensures your story’s foundation is rooted in modern cognitive science:  

- **Dopamine-Aligned Stories** focus on external goals and cause-effect dynamics, emphasizing linear, task-oriented progression.  
- **Serotonin-Aligned Stories** prioritize relational and inequity management dynamics, emphasizing balance and interconnectedness.  

By aligning your Storyform to one of these cognitive styles, Subtxt dynamically adjusts:  

1. **Throughline Order**: Reflects the narrative’s priorities, whether goal-driven or relational.  
2. **Story Drivers**: Adapts the prominence of cause-effect progressions versus intent-driven dynamics.  
3. **Terminology**: Ensures the tools resonate with the cognitive style of the story.

### Why Narrative Alignment Matters  

Narrative Alignment helps you shape a story that resonates with your audience by ensuring the narrative’s structure and tools reflect its core cognitive perspective. Whether you’re crafting a Dopamine-aligned epic like _Gladiator_ or a Serotonin-aligned journey like _Forrest Gump_, Subtxt equips you with the insights and tools to bring your vision to life.

## The Science Behind Cognitive Alignment  

Every story we tell and every decision we make is shaped by the intricate dance of neurotransmitters in the brain. Among these, dopamine and serotonin hold a special significance. While dopamine is named for its precursor L-DOPA and its classification as a monoamine neurotransmitter, serotonin owes its name to its initial discovery in blood serum and its connection to vascular tone regulation. These origins hint at the distinct ways these molecules influence our minds: dopamine, with its task-driven precision, aligns with structured, goal-oriented processes, while serotonin, fostering balance and social harmony, resonates with relational and contextual thinking.  

This duality—reward-based versus relational, linear versus contextual—reflects a deeper interplay between states and processes, often manifesting as binary and analog biases. In storytelling, these forces provide the framework for narratives that balance progression and resolution with interconnectedness and emotional depth. Understanding the science behind this balance offers a powerful lens through which we can craft and interpret stories that resonate on both cognitive and emotional levels.  

### Dopamine vs. Serotonin: The Brain’s Cognitive Forces  

Cognitive Alignment is grounded in the interplay of two key neurotransmitter systems:  

1. **Dopamine (Reward-Based)**  
   - Drives goal-oriented, task-focused behaviors.  
   - Fosters linear, cause-effect thinking.  
   - Encourages external achievement and resolution.  

2. **Serotonin (Relational-Based)**  
   - Regulates emotional stability and promotes social bonding.  
   - Supports inequity management by considering relationships and broader contexts.  
   - Prioritizes balance and interconnectedness over isolated goals.  

### Gender and Neurochemical Influence  

While Cognitive Alignment is not strictly bound by gender, there is a **general correlation** between biological sex and the dominance of these neurotransmitter systems, influenced by hormonal and neurodevelopmental factors:  

- **Dopamine-Alignment and Males**:  
   - Elevated levels of testosterone during fetal development and postnatal life enhance dopamine pathways.  
   - This predisposes many males to linear, goal-oriented, reward-based Internal Processing.  

- **Serotonin-Alignment and Females**:  
   - Higher levels of estrogen promote serotonin activity, which fosters relational, inequitable, and context-sensitive processing.  
   - This aligns many females with relational-based cognitive frameworks.  

### Biological Flexibility  

It’s important to note that these correlations reflect **tendencies**, not absolutes.  
- Both males and females utilize dopamine and serotonin systems, and individual variations often transcend simple binary categorizations.  
- These foundational tendencies can be reshaped by direct biological interventions (as detailed below).

### The Prenatal "Neurochemical Tilt"  

The origins of Cognitive Alignment can be traced back to prenatal brain development, during which neurotransmitter pathways are shaped by hormonal activity:  

1. **Critical Development Periods**  
   - Between weeks **8-16 of pregnancy**, surges in hormones such as testosterone and estrogen influence brain structure and neurotransmitter systems.  
   - This creates a **neurochemical tilt** favoring either dopamine-dominant (linear) or serotonin-dominant (relational) processing.  

2. **Hormonal Influence**  
   - Elevated **testosterone** enhances dopamine pathways, promoting focus on cause-effect dynamics and external achievement.  
   - Increased **estrogen** amplifies serotonin pathways, supporting relational thinking and emotional regulation.  

As these prenatal influences establish the **structural foundation** of neurotransmitter pathways—defining the brain's default tilt toward dopamine or serotonin dominance—Subtxt models this fixed structure as a key element of narrative psychology. These foundational pathways serve as the "operating system" for Internal Processing, providing a stable framework upon which dynamic, postnatal experiences, environment, and culture layer additional context and nuance. This structural foundation allows Subtxt to reflect the inherent stability of these systems while enabling the exploration of how stories evolve within their constraints.

### States and Processes: Interplay Between Fixed and Fluid  

Cognitive Alignment fits within a broader framework of states (fixed attributes) and processes (dynamic elements) within the mind:  

1. **States (Fixed Attributes)**  
   - **Physical Sex**: Determined at birth and fixed unless altered biologically (e.g., through surgery).  
   - **Cognitive Alignment**: Also set at birth, based on the brain’s neurochemical tilt toward dopamine or serotonin dominance.  

2. **Processes (Dynamic Elements)**  
   - **Gender Identity**: How an individual identifies on the spectrum of gender, expressed through pronouns and personal identity (he/him, she/her, they/them). This is fluid and can change over time.  
   - **Gender Preference**: Cognitive and emotional preferences, including attraction (external) and ways of thinking (internal). These preferences are also fluid and influenced by experience and context.  

### Reshaping Fixed States  

While Physical Sex and Cognitive Alignment are foundational, they can be altered through direct influence on biology:  

- **Physical Sex**: Can be re-set through medical procedures, such as hormone therapy or surgery, creating a new fixed state until altered again.  
- **Cognitive Alignment**: Though traditionally immutable, it can be temporarily shifted through pharmacological interventions or neurological techniques. For example:  
   - Dopamine-aligned processing can be numbed or augmented with drugs affecting dopamine pathways.  
   - Serotonin-aligned processing can be influenced similarly, altering relational awareness.  

These changes, however, are typically impermanent and do not completely rewire the foundational "boot record" of the mind.

## Real-World Example: *Barbie* (2023)  

Greta Gerwig’s *Barbie* provides a powerful illustration of Cognitive Alignment in action. The film's layered narrative contains two distinct Storyforms, each showcasing a different cognitive perspective. This duality is likely a reflection of the collaborative writing efforts of Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, with each writer contributing a unique cognitive lens to the story:

1. **Barbie and Ken’s Story**  
   - **Cognitive Alignment: Dopamine (Reward-Based)**  
   - Likely contributed by Noah Baumbach, this Storyform focuses on meeting societal expectations and exploring conflict through cause-and-effect dynamics.  
   - Ken’s quest for self-worth is rooted in a linear, goal-oriented framework, driven by his attempts to embody traditional masculinity.  
   - This approach aligns with dopamine-driven narratives, emphasizing direct resolution and external rewards.  
   - For example, Ken’s efforts to define himself revolve around tangible achievements, such as seizing power and recognition, illustrating a clear reward-based processing style.

2. **Barbie and Gloria’s Story**  
   - **Cognitive Alignment: Serotonin (Relational-Based)**  
   - Likely contributed by Greta Gerwig, this Storyform examines the cycle of life, self-awareness, and the interplay of relationships through a intra-relational perspective.  
   - Barbie’s journey toward self-actualization is guided by interconnectedness and emotional harmony, reflecting the serotonin-aligned emphasis on balance and relational dynamics.  
   - For instance, Barbie’s understanding of her purpose evolves through her relationship with Gloria and her broader awareness of interconnected experiences, a hallmark of relational-based processing.  

These two Storyforms not only highlight the interplay between dopamine and serotonin alignments but also reflect the creative synthesis of Gerwig and Baumbach’s narrative styles. Together, they provide audiences with a richly layered exploration of thematic depth, blending reward-based and relation-based storytelling approaches into a cohesive whole.

## A Matter of Emphasis and Intent  

To help writers better understand the composition of their narratives, Subtxt adjusts its interface based on the Cognitive Alignment of the story. This approach tailors the tools and processes to reflect the distinct characteristics of Dopamine- and Serotonin-aligned stories.

Subtxt focuses **Dopamine-aligned stories** on linear, cause-and-effect components, while **Serotonin-aligned stories** emphasize interconnectedness and balancing inequities. These adjustments appear in several key areas:

- The order of Throughlines  
- The presence of Story Drivers  
- Storyform considerations  
- The order of Thematic Cycles in a Storybeat  

---

### The Order of Throughlines  

The Cognitive Alignment of a story influences the priority and arrangement of Throughlines:  

1. **Dopamine-Aligned Stories**:  
   - **Order**: Objective Story → Main Character → Catalyst Provocateur → Relationship Story.  
   - Emphasizes external plot and goal-driven conflict resolution, with secondary focus on subjective dynamics.  

2. **Serotonin-Aligned Stories**:  
   - **Order**: Main Character → Relationship Story → Catalyst Provocateur → Objective Story.  
   - Prioritizes relational and internal dynamics, with external plot considerations coming last.  

For example:  
- Dopamine-aligned stories, such as _Gladiator_, focus on the pursuit of clear, goal-oriented objectives.  
- Serotonin-aligned stories, like _Forrest Gump_ or _Moulin Rouge!_, foreground the individual’s emotional journey and relationships before addressing broader external conflicts.  

---

### Adjusting the Presence of Story Drivers  

**Story Drivers** are the underlying cause-and-effect connections between Storybeats, primarily tied to the Objective Story Throughline. Subtxt handles these differently based on Cognitive Alignment:  

1. **Dopamine-Aligned Stories**:  
   - Story Drivers are prominent throughout the narrative, maintaining a clear and logical progression of events.  

2. **Serotonin-Aligned Stories**:  
   - Story Drivers are de-emphasized, particularly at the beginning, allowing the narrative to focus on intention and direction over strict causality.  

This design reflects the Serotonin-aligned mind's tendency to prioritize relational dynamics and contextual understanding over linear progressions.  

---

### Storyform Considerations  

Subtxt modifies Storyform terminology and relationships to match the selected Cognitive Alignment.  

- **Dopamine-Aligned Stories**:  
   - **Problem/Solution** → Focused on achieving external resolution.  
   - **Focus/Direction** → Cause-effect dynamics.  

- **Serotonin-Aligned Stories**:  
   - **Condition/Adjustment** → Relational and systemic perspectives.  
   - **Resistance/Flow** → Processes of balancing inequities.  

These shifts ensure the terminology aligns with the thematic and structural focus of the chosen alignment.  

---

### The Order of Thematic Cycles  

Thematic Cycles differ between the two alignments, reflecting the distinct ways each mind processes and resolves inequities:  

1. **Dopamine-Aligned Stories**:  
   - Material → Spatial → Temporal.  
   - Focuses on external, tangible elements before considering abstract or relational concerns.  

2. **Serotonin-Aligned Stories**:  
   - Temporal → Spatial → Material.  
   - Begins with context and interconnectedness, ending with tangible outcomes.  

These differences highlight the blind spots inherent to each alignment:  
- **Dopamine-Aligned Minds**: Struggle with interconnectedness or relational concerns.  
- **Serotonin-Aligned Minds**: May overlook material or structural considerations.
