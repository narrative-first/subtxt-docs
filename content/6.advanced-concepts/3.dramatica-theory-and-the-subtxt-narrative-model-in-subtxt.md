title: Dramatica Theory and the Subtxt Narrative Model in Subtxt
description: Bridging foundational narrative theory with a modern approach.
---

Many familiar with the Dramatica® theory of story will notice conceptual similarities between its approach and the Subtxt Narrative Model (SNM) used within Subtxt. While inspired by foundational principles, the SNM represents a modernized framework that evolves beyond Dramatica’s original system through advancements in computational modeling, AI-assisted storytelling, and interactive narrative applications.

These updates stem from years of practical application in real-world projects, as well as the need for a more flexible and adaptive model that aligns with contemporary AI and large-language models (LLMs).

To ensure accessibility and broad adoption, the Subtxt Narrative Model is maintained as an independent standard. Subtxt is the first and most advanced implementation of the model.

## From Dramatica to the Subtxt Narrative Model: An Evolution, Not a Replacement  

Originally, Subtxt was designed as a tool to teach and clarify Dramatica theory. Created by an innovator deeply involved in Dramatica’s development and a former instructor of its principles at California Institute of the Arts, Subtxt began as a way to apply its ideas practically.

However, as storytelling and technology evolved, so did the framework behind Subtxt. While the Subtxt Narrative Model retains many of the structural insights that made Dramatica revolutionary, it expands upon them by:
- Refining thematic relationships based on modern computational analysis.  
- Fixing known limitations in Dramatica’s event sequencing algorithms.  
- Adapting the model for AI-driven applications and interactive storytelling.  

While Dramatica formalized a strong theoretical foundation, the Subtxt Narrative Model builds upon it, ensuring narrative cohesion, accuracy, and accessibility without requiring theoretical study. Subtxt is the best place to learn, apply, and explore this evolution.

## Structural Differences: Key Enhancements in the Subtxt Narrative Model

### Plot Progressions: A More Accurate Order of Events  
One of the most significant differences between Dramatica and the Subtxt Narrative Model is how Plot Progressions unfold. The SNM refines and improves event sequencing algorithms, resulting in story structures that better reflect narrative dynamics in practice.

This difference is intentional. The Subtxt Narrative Model’s computational modeling produces Storyforms that may differ from those found in previous applications, yet writers familiar with both tend to find the SNM’s sequences more accurate, intuitive, and flexible for real-world storytelling.

### Influence Character vs. Influence Character  
Subtxt retains the term "Influence Character" rather than adopting "Influence Character", "Impact Character", "Obstacle Character." While all these terms point toward a similar role—providing a counterpoint or challenge to the Main Character's entrenched perspectives—"Influence Character" best captures the true narrative function and dynamic of this role within a story.

At its core, the obstacle presented by this character perspective is fundamentally about challenging and disrupting the Main Character’s justifications. Traditional terms like "Obstacle Character" accurately reflect the oppositional nature of this perspective but have historically caused confusion, especially among foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), which mistakenly equate "Obstacle" directly with "Antagonist." This conflation can significantly limit narrative clarity, misrepresenting the nuanced role of this pivotal perspective.

Similarly, terms like "Influence Character" or "Impact Character" accurately convey aspects of the dynamic but fail to encapsulate the active and dynamic force this character embodies in the narrative structure. They effectively communicate that this character affects the Main Character but don't inherently suggest the provocative, transformational impetus crucial to meaningful character growth.

"Influence Character," however, directly emphasizes the dual purpose and core strength of this narrative perspective:

- **Catalyst:** Highlights the transformative, reaction-inducing nature, compelling the Main Character to reconsider and ultimately question their foundational beliefs and justifications.
- **Provocateur:** Suggests a deliberate, conscious act of provoking conflict or tension to facilitate deeper introspection and meaningful evolution within the Main Character.

By framing this perspective as a "Influence Character," Subtxt distinctly and accurately defines this character's narrative function, fostering a more precise, nuanced understanding among both writers and advanced LLM systems. It underscores the importance of this role as a powerful catalyst for essential growth, whether active, direct, or indirect, rather than merely passive influence or unintended antagonism.

Ultimately, "Influence Character" encapsulates precisely why this character is essential—not merely as an obstacle, antagonist, or influencer, but as the critical agent provocatively igniting transformation and compelling the Main Character toward genuine growth.

### Narrative Fabric vs. Story Limit  
The Narrative Fabric in the SNM refines what Dramatica previously called the Story Limit.

Rather than defining a "limit" that constrains a story, the SNM recognizes that storytelling involves the relationship between objective and subjective realities—the author's perspective vs. the audience’s experience.

For broad audience appeal, most stories should default to Spacetime. However, for those experimenting with more nonlinear, immersive, or interactive narratives, Subtxt allows for Timespace configurations, which reverse this relationship dynamically.

### Narrative Alignment: Moving Beyond "Mental Sex"  
The Subtxt Narrative Model introduces Narrative Alignment, a refinement of what Dramatica called Mental Sex or Problem-Solving Style.

Rather than relying on outdated gendered terminology, the SNM aligns this concept with modern cognitive science:

- **Serotonin-Based Alignment** (formerly "Female Mental Sex"):  
  - Focuses on relational, contextual, and holistic thinking.  
  - Seeks to balance inequities and interpret interconnected processes.  
- **Dopamine-Based Alignment** (formerly "Male Mental Sex"):  
  - Emphasizes goal-driven, cause-and-effect reasoning.  
  - Prefers linear progressions and directed problem-solving. 

| **Dramatica (Original)** | **Subtxt Narrative Model (Serotonin-aligned)** |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Problem                            | Condition                                         |
| Solution                           | Adjustment                                        |
| Focus                              | Resistance                                        |
| Direction                          | Flow                                              |
| Story Goal                         | Story Intention                                   |
| Story Consequence                  | Story Overwhelm                                   |
| Story Dividends                    | Story Excitement                                  |
| Story Costs                        | Story Pressure                                    |
| Story Forewarnings                 | Story Ennui                                       |
| Story Requirements                 | Story Habituation                                 |
| Story Prerequisites                | Story Internalization                             |
| Story Preconditions                | Story Socialization                               |

This shift better captures cognitive diversity and provides a more intuitive, neuroscience-informed approach to understanding character perspectives.

### Dynamic Vector: \"Relinquished\" Instead of \"Changed\"  
Within the Subtxt Narrative Model, the Dynamic Vector replaces Dramatica’s “Changed vs. Steadfast” with “Relinquished vs. Maintained.”

This adjustment clarifies how Main Characters evolve in a narrative:

- **Relinquished** (formerly \"Changed\") – The Main Character abandons a prior method of problem-solving in response to narrative pressure.  
- **Maintained** (formerly \"Steadfast\") – The Main Character continues using their existing approach, reinforcing their internal justification.

This distinction eliminates confusion—since all Main Characters experience some degree of transformation, the key factor is what is relinquished versus maintained rather than whether they “change” or not.

### Serotonin-Aligned Narratives: \"Released\" vs. \"Sustained\"  
For serotonin-aligned narratives, the Dynamic Vector uses "Released vs. Sustained":

- **Released** – The Main Character experiences a sense of letting go, releasing previously held beliefs, emotions, or approaches.
- **Sustained** – The Main Character maintains or holds onto their current beliefs, emotions, or approaches, continuing their existing path.

This framing emphasizes an overall sense of either release or sustained commitment, highlighting the subtle emotional shifts characters experience.

### Endings in Serotonin-Aligned Narratives
In serotonin-aligned narratives, endings don't definitively conclude the story but rather gently subside, reflecting emotional and cognitive states:

**Released Narratives:**

| Outcome | Emotional State |
|---------|-----------------|
| Success/Good | Centered |
| Failure/Good | Being Present |
| Success/Bad | Stagnant |
| Failure/Bad | Disconnected |

**Sustained Narratives:** *(Success/Failure does not alter the narrative structure)*

| Emotional Quality | State |
|-------------------|-------|
| Good | Composed |
| Bad | Inert |

These nuanced endings capture the gradual emotional transitions that serotonin-aligned narratives typically portray, resonating deeply with the audience's sense of resolution or lingering tension.

### **Reframing the Four Core Storypoints**  

The traditional **Dramatica Storypoints**—Domain, Concern, Issue, and Problem—have been **restructured using Form, Field, Facet, and Force** to provide a **more intentional approach** to identifying conflict.  

| **Dramatica Term** | **Subtxt Narrative Model** | 
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Domain  | Form  |
| Concern | Field |
| Issue   | Facet |
| Problem | Force |

With Force, there are four **sub-forces** that you will encounter, one for Dopamine-aligned narratives, and another for Serotonin-aligned narratives:

| **Dramatica Term** | **Dopamined-Aligned** | 
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Problem  | Problem  |
| Symptom | Focus |
| Response   | Direction |
| Solution | Solution |

In addition, the We perspective in a Dopamine-aligned narrative will also use the following sub-forces:

| **Dramatica Term** | **Serotonin-Aligned** | 
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Problem  | Condition  |
| Symptom | Resistance |
| Response   | Flow |
| Solution | Adjustment |

### Narrative Methods of Conflict: Refining the Four Domains  
The Subtxt Narrative Model updates Dramatica’s four Domains to align with modern AI-driven analysis:

| Dramatica Domain | Subtxt Narrative Model |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Universe         | External Framing       |
| Mind            | Internal Framing       |
| Physics         | External Processing    |
| Psychology      | Internal Processing    |

These refinements improve narrative generation, analysis, and AI-assisted development, ensuring a clearer distinction between thematic functions.

### Structural Terminology: SNM’s Enhancements Over Dramatica  
To further clarify structure vs. storytelling, Subtxt updates key Dramatica terms:

- **Transits** replace Signposts.  
- **Progressions** replace Sequences.  
- **Events** (a new structural layer) introduce clearer micro-level beats.  

This enhanced framework ensures writers understand the relationship between structural elements and storytelling beats, independent of traditional chapters, scenes, or acts.

## Final Thoughts: The Future of Narrative Structure  

By shifting from Dramatica Theory to the Subtxt Narrative Model, Subtxt modernizes story structure for the future.

Unlike static, closed systems, the SNM is an evolving framework developed in collaboration with industry professionals and real-world applications.
