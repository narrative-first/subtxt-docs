title: Storyform Builder
description: Construct compelling narratives by translating ideas into structured arguments
---

The Storyform Builder is a high-level, manual tool designed to help you craft the perfect argument for your story based on your creative intent. It requires a deep understanding of the narrative concepts embedded in Subtxt, making it an advanced feature for those looking to elevate their storytelling craft. The builder is divided into multiple sections, each designed to guide you through the process of constructing a compelling, cohesive storyform.

### **Surface-Level Storytelling vs. Narrative Structure**

Before diving into the details of the Storyform Builder, it’s important to remember the fundamental distinction in Subtxt between **Surface-level Storytelling** and **Narrative Structure**. This division reflects two layers of crafting a story:

1. **Surface-level Storytelling** focuses on what the audience perceives—the Narrative Argument and Genre selection, which appear at the top of the Storyform Builder. These elements shape the broader, thematic arc of your story and represent how your narrative will be understood by the audience.
   
2. **Narrative Structure** delves into the underlying mechanics of your story’s meaning. Everything below the top section is designed to support the deeper, structural elements of your story, including character arcs, throughlines, and pivotal elements. This is where the essence of Subtxt’s methodology shines, ensuring that your narrative remains consistent and meaningful.

By keeping this distinction in mind, you can more effectively use the Storyform Builder to balance the emotional and intellectual aspects of storytelling—providing a seamless experience for your audience while maintaining the integrity of your story's structure.

### **Building Storyforms**

When building a storyform, Subtxt doesn't merely pull from a pre-made "look-up" table of narratives. While pre-built options might occasionally be available, the Subtxt Narrative Engine 2021 (c) supports over 32,000 unique storyforms. The process of building a new storyform typically takes 5–12 minutes, depending on its complexity.

If your requested storyform has already been built, Subtxt will use the existing version. Otherwise, it will create the storyform from scratch, and you’ll receive an email notification once it’s ready. Note that due to demand and the computational resources required, you can only build one storyform at a time.

---

### **Narrative Argument**

At the top of the Storyform Builder, you'll find the **Narrative Argument**, which serves as a concise, one-sentence distillation of your storyform. This sentence encapsulates the Dynamics, Storypoints, and Storybeats into a focused statement: the argument you, as the author, are making with your story.

The Narrative Argument is composed of two parts:
1. **Character** - Reflecting the emotional and personal arc of the story.
2. **Plot** - Highlighting the external journey and key events.

You can adjust these elements using drop-down menus to select various storytelling illustrations, which seamlessly integrate with Subtxt’s approach: summarizing at the top while detailing components below. Once adjustments are made, clicking the up arrow prompts Subtxt to analyze your selections, craft a tailored Narrative Argument, and provide an in-depth explanation of its implications for your story.

If the argument resonates with your intent, scroll to the bottom and click **"Build this Storyform"** to initiate the process of constructing your story.

---

### **Story Type and Genre Selection**

Just below the Narrative Argument section, you'll encounter a question: **"What kind of story do you want to write?"** This section provides a selection box with a list of typical genres, such as Action/Adventure, Courtroom Drama, and more. While not exhaustive, these genres serve as a starting point, shaping the four throughlines and their sources of conflict. For example:

- Choosing **Action/Adventure** might emphasize physical challenges and external stakes.
- Opting for **Courtroom Drama** could prioritize intellectual debates and moral dilemmas.

Your selection will also adjust the Story Drivers (major plot points), which will be explored further down.

---

### **Narrative Personality and Pivotal Elements**

Below the Narrative Argument box are two major sections:

1. **Narrative Personality**  
   This section defines the overarching "personality" of your story by assigning the Four Throughlines (Objective Story, Main Character, Influence Character, Relationship Story) to four different **Domains of Conflict**:
   - External Framing
   - External Processing
   - Internal Processing
   - Internal Framing

   Using a drag-and-drop interface, you can rearrange the tiles representing these domains. Subtxt dynamically adjusts the other tiles to maintain thematic consistency. For example:
   - The Main Character (MC) and Influence Character (CP) Throughlines must be dynamically opposed, reflecting their "You and I are alike" relationship.
   - The Objective Story (OS) and Relationship Story (RS) Throughlines are similarly opposed.

   This creates eight possible combinations, each lending a unique "personality" to your story. For instance:
   - Default Setup: MC in External Framing, OS in External Processing (common in Action/Adventure).
   - Alternate Setup: OS in Internal Processing (typical for Coming-of-Age stories).

2. **Goal/Intention Box**  
   Located just below the tile interaction, this box reflects the Goal of your story, influenced by the Source of Conflict in the Objective Story. For example:
   - OS in External Processing offers goals like **Understanding, Doing, Obtaining,** and **Learning.**
   - OS in Internal Processing includes **Conceptualizing, Being, Becoming,** and **Conceiving.**

   Selecting a goal updates the tiles above and affects the available **Pivotal Elements**. By toggling the **Narrative Family/Goal switch** in the upper right, you can explore different goal families:
   - Foundational
   - Functional
   - Latent
   - Deliberative

   These families naturally align with the selected goals and dictate the Pivotal Elements available for your story, ensuring thematic cohesion.

---

### **Pivotal Elements**

The **Pivotal Elements** box allows you to define the core positions represented by the Main and Influence Characters, forming the foundation of their "You and I" argument. For instance:
- Selecting **Faith** for the MC automatically assigns **Disbelief** to the OC, illustrating their thematic opposition.

This interplay highlights the duality in your story and supports the broader argument you’re crafting. Adjusting these elements dynamically affects other storyform components, reinforcing the integrated nature of Subtxt’s narrative design.

---

### **Story Drivers**

Finally, you can choose the driving force of your story: **Action** or **Decision.** The default selection aligns with conventional expectations for your chosen genre:
- Courtroom Dramas typically prioritize **Decisions** as drivers.
- Action/Adventure stories often emphasize **Actions.**

While these conventions serve as helpful guidelines, you are free to deviate based on your storytelling intent.

---

### **Storyform Settings**

The **Storyform Settings** section is the final place where you have direct control over your story’s narrative structure. The options you choose here are pivotal, as they define the purpose, orientation, and outcome of your story’s argument. These choices ripple throughout the storyform, influencing character arcs, thematic consistency, and narrative development.

#### **Purpose of the Argument**

This setting allows you to define the overarching purpose of your story’s argument. The choice reflects whether your story is **Dopamine-aligned** or **Serotonin-aligned**:

- **Achieving a Goal (Dopamine-aligned)**: Focuses on external outcomes and tangible results.
- **Setting an Intention (Serotonin-aligned)**: Centers on internal balance and personal growth.

#### **Orientation of the Argument**

Here, you determine how your story’s argument approaches conflict, whether by letting go of an old way or maintaining a current approach:

- **Dopamine Stories**:
  - **Relinquished**: Letting go of old approaches to pursue a new way.
  - **Maintained**: Holding firm to a current path despite challenges.

- **Serotonin Stories**:
  - **Released**: Resolving internal or external tension to find harmony.
  - **Sustained**: Continuing forward with resilience and growth.

#### **Ending that Proves the Argument**

Your choice of ending solidifies the argument and determines the emotional resolution of your story:

- **Dopamine Stories**:
  - **Triumph**: Success in achieving the goal.
  - **Virtuous**: Failure that highlights perseverance.
  - **Bleak**: Success, but at a moral or ethical cost.
  - **Tragedy**: Failure that solidifies the futility of the pursuit.

- **Serotonin Stories**:
  - **Serotonin/Released**
    - **Centered**: Achieving inner peace by fully resolving internal tensions.
    - **Being Present**: A peaceful coexistence with the current state.
    - **Stagnant**: Moving forward, yet feeling stuck.
    - **Disconnected**: A poignant separation from intention or meaning.
  - **Serotonin/Sustained**
    - **Composed**: Sustaining emotional equilibrium despite unresolved tensions.
    - **Inert**: Remaining stuck emotionally due to an inability to overcome internal obstacles.

### **Additional Features**

#### **Plot Map Toggle**

On the **Purpose of the Argument** selection box, there’s a **Map Toggle** feature that provides a quick visual representation of your story’s plot.  
- **Dopamine Stories**: The map showcases how the plot unfolds from Consequence to Goal, emphasizing external stakes and progress.
- **Serotonin Stories**: The map highlights how Overwhelm balances out with Intention, focusing on internal resolution and balance.

This feature gives you a bird’s-eye view of how your narrative will progress, allowing you to refine your settings with greater confidence.

#### **Narrative Fabric**

Hidden within this section is the **Narrative Fabric** setting, typically defaulted to **Spacetime** (the most common setup, used in over 87% of narratives). However, if you wish to experiment with holding time as an objective reality—such as for stories emphasizing deadlines or durations—you can switch to **Timespace**.  

- To adjust this setting:
  - Use the **Cmd+E** shortcut to bring up the field selector.
  - Or explicitly set it in your account’s **Preference Settings**.

The Narrative Field influences how time and space are treated within your story’s framework, adding another layer of depth to your narrative design.

### **Building the Storyform**

Once you’ve finalized your settings and reviewed the Character Arcs, you have two options for building the storyform. You can either build it as a completely new story or use the dropdown menu to select an existing story from your account to attach the storyform to. If the storyform has already been built, the process will be quick and immediate. However, if a new storyform needs to be created, it may take up to 20 minutes to finish. Subtxt will handle the construction process and notify you via email once it’s complete.

While a Storyform is being built, you will not be able to access your story in either Muse or the Develop Workspace. This is to ensure the integrity of the system during the construction process. As soon as the Storyform Builder completes, you will receive an email notification indicating that your story is ready for access with the new Storyform.
