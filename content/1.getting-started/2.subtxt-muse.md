## Think Your Story into Existence

**Subtxt Muse**™️ (our multi-agentic narrative assistant) is your always-on, super-intelligent AI writing companion, designed to help you *think* your story into existence. By simply sharing your ideas—whether it's a single concept, a thematic exploration, or an entire first act—Muse will capture, organize, and shape those thoughts into meaningful and structured narrative elements, ensuring that your creativity is seamlessly saved into the Subtxt/Dramatica platform.

With Muse, you're not just jotting down ideas; you're *building* a story. Think of it like working alongside a master storyteller—someone who understands your intent and helps refine your vision as you go. Whether you're brainstorming or refining, Muse will progressively guide you from an initial idea to a fully realized narrative.

## A Vision of the Future: Creating Stories as Easily as You Can Speak Them

Imagine sitting down to develop a new story and having a tool that instantly picks up on your intentions. You can start throwing out ideas, and Muse will help form them into the narrative structure required to craft a compelling and thematically rich story. It's like having a virtual "writer's room" where the more you contribute, the better Muse helps shape and evolve your work.

### Sci-Fi Made Reality

In the fourth season of HBO’s _Westworld_, the protagonist works at a futuristic game company where stories are built on the fly through dynamic collaboration with advanced tools. While Muse may not be creating expansive game worlds (not yet!), it offers a similar experience for writers—helping you quickly shape and refine your ideas into fully realized stories.
