# Welcome to Subtxt/Dramatica¬Æ

üëã **Welcome!** Subtxt/Dramatica is your go-to platform designed to **enrich your storytelling and elevate your creative writing**. Rather than writing your story for you, it acts as a knowledgeable mentor, guiding you on the journey of crafting a meaningful and well-rounded narrative.

Paired with the multi-agentic **Muse**, our platform enhances your creative process even further. Muse allows you to effortlessly organize and structure your ideas, enabling you to focus purely on storytelling. It frees you from the tedious task of figuring out where your ideas fit, empowering your creative energy to shine.

Unlike other narrative tools, Subtxt/Dramatica isn't designed to generate an entire story at the click of a button. Despite all the buzz surrounding AI, that sort of automated approach completely misses the essence of the creative act; anyone advocating for it isn't truly engaging as a serious creator. 

Instead, Subtxt/Dramatica challenges you to deeply consider the 'why' and 'what' behind your narrative, fostering genuine creativity and thoughtful storytelling. What message do you wish to convey? Why does this story matter to you? This reflective approach makes the storytelling process deeply rewarding.

The Subtxt/Dramatica platform does, however, generate a rich, structured outline. This outline serves as your springboard into your preferred writing software, where your words can flourish.

## First Things First

We're in a state of transition as Narrative First's Subtxt merges with Write Bros.' Dramatica. While we settle in, know that:

- The **Subtxt Narrative Engine** powers the platform
- **Dramatica** is the groundbreaking narrative theory that started everything
- **Subtxt/Dramatica** is the current name of the platform that supports in-app story development as well as 3rd party exploration through APIs and in Q3 2025 MCP integrations.

## Getting Started

New here? No worries‚Äîwe've prepared a step-by-step guide to help you explore and master the storyforming process.

### Step 1: Explore Ideas with Muse

Start your storytelling journey in the **Muse Workspace**:

* **Brainstorm and refine your ideas**: Muse is your creative companion, evolving alongside your narrative:

  * "I want to write a story about two elves..."
  * "Take Hamlet‚Äôs structure and set it in early 18th-century Philippines."

* **Find your Storyform with Muse**:

  * ‚ÄúGuide me through the Storyforming process.‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat are the Four Throughlines of my story?‚Äù

Muse helps you shape your Storyform step-by-step. Once finalized, your Storyform is available in:

* **Muse Workspace**
* **Develop Workspace**

### Step 2: Navigating the Muse Workspace

A single Story can have multiple Storyforms (e.g _Jerry Maguire_, _Barbie_, etc.)
::

* **Refining your Storyform**: Ask Muse targeted questions, such as:

  * ‚ÄúRefine the Influence Character Focus and Direction.‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúIllustrate a Relationship Story Benchmark.‚Äù

* **Saving your ideas thoughtfully**:

  * Choose to save concepts to your "Storyform" for structured progression or to your "Story" if you're still exploring. This flexibility lets you experiment without immediate commitment.

Your saved ideas remain accessible in Muse and ready for deeper refinement in the Develop Workspace.

### Step 3: Transitioning to the Develop Workspace

Ready for deeper exploration? Move into the **Develop Workspace** by:

* Clicking ‚ÄúDevelop‚Äù on your Muse Workspace Storyform page.
* Selecting ‚ÄúDevelop‚Äù from your Stories listing page.

The Develop Workspace guides you through four key phases:

1. **Forming**

   * Establish your story‚Äôs foundation by completing essential elements of your Storyform‚Äîyour narrative blueprint.

2. **Illustrating**

   * Access all Storypoints and Storybeats, refining narrative subtext with Muse for richer storytelling.

3. **Plotting**

   * Organize your storyform elements into chronological "Moments," translating your structure into a clear event sequence.

4. **Writing**

   * Ensure your storytelling elements align perfectly. Export your detailed **Dramatica Treatment** for seamless integration into your favorite writing software.
