description: Discover a new way to spark your creativity and guide your storytelling journey

When you enter the **Develop Workspace** from **Story Central** or the **Welcome screen**, you’ll be greeted with a selection of **Story Starters**—original, AI-generated prompts crafted by Muse to kickstart your creativity. These Story Starters provide a foundation for your storytelling journey, offering a compelling **logline, genre, and the four throughlines** to help you understand how different narrative elements fit together.

### How It Works
- **Daily Inspiration**: Every night, Muse generates new Story Starters across a wide range of genres—including some you won’t find anywhere else!
- **Easy to Get Started**: Simply **tap a Story Starter** that interests you, confirm your selection, and Subtxt will copy all the relevant details into your personal workspace.
- **Completely Customizable**: These are just starting points—adjust a Throughline, rework the premise, or take the story in a completely different direction. The goal is to **set you up for success** while leaving creative freedom in your hands.
- **Not AI-Written Stories**: Worry not! Muse isn’t writing entire stories—just providing the framework. The rest is up to you.

### Where to Find Story Starters
- **Story Central**: Tap the **Develop Workspace** tile to access the latest selection of starters.
- **Welcome Screen**: If you’re jumping into Subtxt for the first time, you’ll see the option to explore Story Starters right away.
- **Default Storyform Option**: Not interested in a pre-made starter? You can always choose to start with the default storyform—an empty structure based on the typical narrative model found in Western storytelling.

Story Starters provide a quick and easy way to dive into storytelling with confidence. Whether you take one as-is, tweak a few details, or simply use them as inspiration, Subtxt ensures you have a solid foundation to build upon. Enjoy exploring new ideas and crafting your own unique narratives!
