Subtxt provides two distinct spaces for engaging with your story: the **Muse Workspace** and the **Develop Workspace**. Each workspace serves a unique purpose, allowing you to approach storytelling from both a creative and a structured perspective.

- The **Muse Workspace** is designed for brainstorming, exploring ideas, and generating new content. It maximizes screen space for freeform exploration and creative discovery.
- The **Develop Workspace** offers a structured environment for diving deeper into narrative concepts, organizing story elements, and refining key details.

These spaces are interconnected, enabling you to move seamlessly between creative exploration and focused development. For example, the "pop-up" version of Muse within the Develop Workspace maintains context for the Storyform currently being explored, ensuring consistency and continuity.

### Muse and the Develop Workspace

Muse is a *conversational workspace* designed for effortless creation and updates of Narrative Aspects like Players, Storypoints, or Storybeats. While Muse allows for freeform exploration, it’s important to note that it will not automatically save storytelling ideas when developing a Storyform. Once you’ve settled on specific Storyform elements, you must explicitly ask Muse to save those elements to ensure they are retained. Simply "speak" your requests into the box below. For example, you might say:

> "Create four new players: John, Steve, Adam, and Henry. John is the Protagonist, and Henry is the Antagonist."

Muse will oblige, add those Players to either the Story or Storyform you are working on, and allow you to view and edit them through the appropriate Portal in Muse (Story or Storyform). However, it’s important to explicitly save the storytelling elements you want to retain into the Storyform. This ensures that your curated narrative details are properly stored and accessible for further development.

If you are looking for "buttons" to add and delete Narrative Aspects like Players, Storypoints, or Storybeats, you would then use the Develop Workspace. The Develop Workspace provides direct controls for structural edits, enabling users to manage these elements in a more hands-on way.

While Muse *can* see what’s in the Develop Workspace, the interaction isn’t fully dynamic yet. Users must manually save any changes made in Muse and refresh the app to synchronize those updates with the Develop Workspace. Without these steps, changes may not immediately reflect across both spaces, which we aim to improve by early 2025. Specifically:

- Changes made in Muse won’t appear immediately in the Develop Workspace unless you manually refresh the app.
- However, Muse is aware of changes you make in the Develop Workspace and will adapt its responses based on those updates.

For now, if you want to see your updated story and all of its components, you will have to manually "refresh" the page (reload the app). This is a current limitation we’re actively working on and hope to have addressed by mid-2025.
