    Already have a draft and a general structure in mind? Subtxt can help you take it to the next level. Upload your draft into Subtxt, aligning it with the context of a **Storyform**.

    If you’re in the brainstorming phase and looking for a spark of inspiration, our platform's tools are perfect for getting started. You can select a **Storyform** inspired by a favorite film or novel—something that resonates with the tone or theme you want to explore. From there, use that structure as a foundation to start generating ideas for your new story.
