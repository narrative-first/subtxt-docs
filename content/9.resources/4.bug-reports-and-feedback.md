The Subtxt/Dramatica platform is an application in rapid development, leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to deliver innovative storytelling support. While we strive to ensure a smooth experience, the dynamic nature of AI means users may occasionally encounter errors or unexpected behavior.  

To stay informed about the latest updates and improvements, be sure to check out the Changelog at the bottom of the Story Central page [https://subtxt.app/story-central](https://subtxt.app/story-central). Updates are made almost daily, ensuring you always have access to the newest features and fixes.

### Reporting Bugs in Subtxt

We greatly value your feedback and bug reports. If you encounter an issue within Subtxt, you can easily report it through the **"Get Help"** option. This is located in the **life-preserver drop-down menu** in the upper-right corner of the application. Your reports help us identify and address issues to improve Subtxt for everyone.

When submitting a bug report, please provide the following details if possible:
- A description of what you were doing when the issue occurred.
- The specific error message (if any) you received.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).

### Understanding "External Service Errors"

One specific error you might encounter is the **"External Service Error"**. This error is related to OpenAI's API services, which power certain AI-driven features in Subtxt/Dramatica. Unfortunately, this type of error is outside of Subtxt’s control, as it originates from OpenAI's systems. 

If you see an "External Service Error," there’s no need to report it to us—we are automatically notified when these errors occur. However, you can monitor OpenAI's system status by visiting their status page: [https://status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com). Please note that their status updates may not always reflect real-time conditions. 

These errors are entirely dependent on OpenAI’s infrastructure, and there is, unfortunately, nothing we can do to resolve them directly. While we understand how frustrating this can be, we want to assure you that we continuously monitor these situations and are ready to restore functionality as soon as OpenAI resolves the issue on their end. If you encounter this issue repeatedly, we recommend trying an alternative approach or revisiting later. Thank you for your understanding and patience!  

### Reporting Other Issues

If you encounter any issues **other than "External Service Errors,"** please don’t hesitate to submit a bug report via the "Get Help" option. These reports are essential for identifying and addressing problems within Subtxt itself.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to enhance Subtxt. Your feedback plays a critical role in shaping the future of the app, and we thank you for your support!
