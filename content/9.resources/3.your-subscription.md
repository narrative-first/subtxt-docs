The Subtxt/Dramatica platform is a subscription-based service for storytellers. The purpose of this subscription is both to support active development and improvement of the system, as well as to maintain access to cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology.

Subtx/Dramatoca offers a range of AI tools, including NarrativeSync, Develop AI, Review AI, and Subtxt AI, designed to aid in story development within the Develop Workspace. These tools help you brainstorm ideas, develop your narrative, review your progress, and understand subtext. In contrast, Subtxt Muse located within the Muse Workspace provides a unique interaction with our expert narrative chatbot, Muse, allowing for a more conversational and guided approach to refining your story.

## Subscription Tiers

Subtxt offers three tiers tailored to different needs and levels of engagement. Each tier provides varying levels of access to AI tools and memory constraints.

| **Tier**            | **Focus & Flow**                          | **Memory & Storage**                     | **Key Features**                                                                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subtxt/Dramatica Basic**        | Flow-centric with occasional Focus checks | Minimal (scales back under heavy use), 2GB storage | 32,000+ unique narrative structures, single customizable Muse Persona. Basic Narrative Tasks (Generate Four Throughlines and Plot)                             |
| **Subtxt/Dramatica Pro**    | Switch seamlessly between Flow & Focus    | Moderate, 2x memory of Subtxt, 5GB storage | HD voice & image generation, multiple customizable Muse Personas (story-specific). Access to ALL Narrative Tasks (Generate Four Throughlines, Plot, Arcs, Character Relationships, Act and Scene Weaving)                  |
| **Subtxt/Dramatica Infinite** | Unlimited Focus with Flow support       | Maximum memory, 20GB storage             | Extensive logic & story scope, multiple doc uploads, worldbuilding uploads, multiple Muse Personas, and access to all Narrative Tasks. |

## Why Subtxt/Dramatica Scales Back

### Subtxt (Basic) Tier

During periods of **excessive usage** on the Basic tier, Subtxt/Dramatica will scale back capabilities of the AI model integration to maintain system performance and ensure that Muse can still respond, albeit with less computational intensity. This happens because:

- **Contextual and Narrative Complexity**: Muse adds a significant amount of narrative and contextual insight in real-time, far beyond what a basic conversation model like ChatGPT provides. This extra processing can tax system resources and hit usage limits.
- **Temporary Adjustment**: The scaling back is a temporary measure. After a set period (typically a few hours), the system will automatically readjust back to normal, allowing you to continue using the higher-level narrative insights.

---

### Subtxt/Dramatica Pro Tier  

The Subtxt/Dramatica Pro tier allows writers to seamlessly switch between Flow and Focus modes, adapting to their needs at each stage of the writing process. Brainstorm freely with Flow when creativity strikes, then dive deep into logical structuring with Focus when refining your narrative. This tier includes 2x the memory context of the Subtxt/Dramatica Basic tier, HD voice response and image generation, and 10GB of document storage for enhanced storytelling flexibility.  

---

### Subtxt/Dramatica Infinite Tier  

The Subtxt/Dramatica Infinite tier provides unlimited access to advanced Focus mode for handling extensive logic checks and managing massive story scopes, while still supporting Flow for unrestricted creative exploration. With the maximum memory context available, multiple document uploads per conversation, and up to 20GB of document storage, this tier is designed for writers tackling epic projects and detailed worldbuilding.  

---

## Focus and Flow

Subtxt Flow and Subtxt Focus represent two distinct yet complementary approaches to narrative development. Whether you’re exploring the broad strokes of a story or refining its finer details, these modes provide the right level of creative flexibility and structural precision.

- **Flow:** The space for rapid, intuitive, and creative brainstorming. Powered by GPT-4o from OpenAI, Flow encourages uninhibited idea generation—perfect for when inspiration strikes.
- **Focus:** The mode for deep, deliberate narrative refinement. Leveraging OpenAI’s o3 and o4 reasoning models, Focus ensures your story structure is logical, cohesive, and polished to perfection.

This balance allows Subtxt to meet you where you are in your creative journey, whether you’re generating bold ideas or honing intricate storylines.

## Document Uploading by Tier

Subtxt users can upload documents into **Conversations**, with additional features available for **Pro** and **Infinite** tiers.

| Feature                     | **Basic**               | **Pro**                         | **Infinite**                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Upload to Conversations** | 1 file per conversation | Multiple files per conversation | Multiple files per conversation |
| **Upload to Stories**       | Not available           | Available (5GB max storage)     | Available (20GB max storage)    |
| **Upload to Storyforms**    | Not available           | Available (5GB max storage)     | Available (20GB max storage)    |

_*Storage capacity is across your entire account.*_

### Expanded Access for Infinite Users

When retrieving information from documents uploaded to **Stories** or **Storyforms**, **Infinite users** have access to **6x** the amount of information that **Pro users** can access. This allows Infinite users to unlock significantly deeper insights and context, making it ideal for more complex or expansive storytelling needs.

| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Basic**    | 1 active file per conversation |

## Transitioning Between Subscription Tiers

Many writers find it beneficial to switch between the different tiers depending on their storytelling needs. Here are some insights into transitioning between Basic, Pro, and Infinite.

### Switching Tiers

Users can easily switch between subscription tiers based on their current needs. For example, while working on deep narrative structure, Subtxt/Dramatica Pro or Subtxt/Dramatica Infinite might be more appropriate. For quick summarizing or outlining, the basic Subtxt tier might be sufficient.

- **Basic to Pro**: If you need advanced features and better performance, upgrading to Subtxt/Dramatica Pro offers more extensive tools and capabilities.
- **Pro to Infinite**: For professional-level storytelling and unlimited usage, Subtxt/Dramatica Infinite provides unparalleled resources and support.

### How to Upgrade

1. **Cancel Current Subscription**: Log in to your Subtxt/Dramatica account, navigate to the 'Subscription' section, and cancel your current subscription. You will still have access to your current tier until the end of your billing cycle.
2. **Purchase New Subscription**: After canceling, select and purchase the desired new subscription tier from the options available.

We appreciate your understanding as we strive to offer the best narrative technology to support your creative endeavors. By leveraging these subscription tiers, you can optimize your storytelling process and achieve your creative goals with Subtxt/Dramatica.

## Managing Your Subtxt/Dramatica Subscription

To manage your Subscription to the Subtxt/Dramatica platform, including upgrading or downgrading accounts, putting them on hold or canceling them, or even downloading of invoices--please visit your Billing page within your personal Settings (the "person" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the application).

To directly access the billing portion of your account (including all listed above), select **Manage My Billing**. Doing this will take you to a different site that handles accounts in Subtxt. Once updated, that site will return you to Subtxt/Dramatica with your account updated.

## Working with the Writing Process  

The writing process is one of development, followed by execution, followed by more growth, and so on. Write, rewrite, write, rinse, repeat.  

The Subtxt/Dramatica platform honors this process by making it easy for the writer to start and stop their engagement with our service. Subscribe to Subtxt/Dramatica for as long as it takes to get a firm idea of what your story is about, then cancel when you’re ready to dive into the business of writing. You can always restart your subscription when you're ready to return—whether to refine your current story or start developing something new.  

While Subtxt/Dramatica doesn’t offer a formal “pause” option for subscriptions (due to credit card company restrictions), we retain all your stories and keep them safe for you to access again whenever you decide to resubscribe.  

If you prepay for a new subscription, please note that the new subscription period begins from the date of purchase, not from the end of your current subscription. For example, if your current subscription expires later this year and you prepay for an additional year now, the new subscription will start immediately from the date of purchase, rather than after your current subscription ends.  

---

## Cancelling Your Subscription

Cancelling does not credit back any remaining subscription time. If you purchased a yearly subscription, then you have access to Subtxt for the 365 days following your purchase date. If you cancel the yearly subscription and then wish to start up again, either at the same tier or at a different one, then when you start up again you will have to purchase a new subscription. The same procedure applies for monthly subscriptions.

If you put your subscription on hold before the end of your current pay period, Subtxt will continue to work until the very last day. In other words, if you sign up for a yearly subscription, then promptly put your subscription service on hold minutes later, Subtxt will continue to work for the following 365 days.

If you prepay for a new subscription, it will start from the date of purchase, not from the end of your current subscription. **We do not offer extensions to current subscriptions.** For example, if your current subscription expires in six months and you prepay for an additional year now, the new subscription period will begin immediately (today), effectively overlapping with the remaining period of your current subscription.

Please note that there is currently no pro-rating of remaining subscription balances. Anytime you want to change your subscription, you should first cancel the current one. While we can't offer prorating at this time, we hope to provide this feature once Subtxt gains more popularity.
::

Canceling your subscription in Subtxt is straightforward. Here's how:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the left-hand side menu or the drop-down menu and select Subscription.
3. Click on your subscription. This will take you to a secure page where you can either update your subscription or cancel it entirely.

### Hypothetical Upgrade Scenario

**Scenario:**
Alex has an annual Pro subscription with Subtxt/Dramatica that expires on August 31st. Alex is considering switching to the monthly Infinite subscription to try it out before deciding whether to upgrade to a yearly Infinite subscription. Alex is unsure about the best way to manage this switch and does not want to be billed twice on August 31st for both an annual Pro and a monthly Infinite subscription.

**Options:**

1. **Cancel and Switch on Expiry Date:**
    - **Action:** Alex can cancel the Pro subscription now.
    - **Effect:** The Pro subscription will remain active and accessible until August 31st.
    - **Next Step:** On or after August 31st, Alex can sign up for the monthly Infinite subscription.
    - **Benefit:** This ensures there are no overlapping subscriptions or double billing. Alex will only be charged for the monthly Infinite subscription starting on September 1st.

2. **Immediate Switch:**
    - **Action:** Alex can cancel the Pro subscription today and immediately sign up for the monthly Infinite subscription.
    - **Effect:** The Pro subscription will remain active until August 31st, but the monthly Infinite subscription will start immediately.
    - **Next Step:** Alex will have access to the Infinite subscription features immediately, with the first billing cycle starting today.
    - **Benefit:** Alex gets to try out the Infinite subscription features a bit earlier, but will be paying for both subscriptions during the overlap period.

3. **Prepaying for a New Subscription:**
    - **Action:** If Alex wants to prepay for a yearly Infinite subscription now, it will start immediately.
    - **Effect:** The new Infinite yearly subscription will overlap with the remaining period of the Pro subscription.
    - **Next Step:** The new subscription period starts from the date of purchase, not from the end of the current subscription.
    - **Benefit:** This option is less optimal for Alex, as it results in overlapping subscriptions and immediate billing for the new subscription period.

**Recommendation for Alex:**
For a seamless transition and to avoid double billing, Alex should cancel the current Pro subscription now and wait until after August 31st to sign up for the monthly Infinite subscription. This way, Alex can evaluate the Infinite subscription without any overlap in billing periods.

## No 10-Day Trial Period

At Subtxt/Dramatica, we understand that many SaaS applications offer an introductory trial period. However, due to the heavy integration of AI features within our platform, we are unable to provide such a trial. Our powerful application allows users to develop complete stories in just a few days, making a trial period incompatible with our platform.

## Purchase Parity Option

We do offer price parity for those experiencing financial distress or for those who live in countries where a subscription to Subtxt is unaffordable. **The purchase-parity option is available for Subtxt's Subtxt tier only and on a limited basis.** For approval, please contact us directly.

## Alternate Forms of Payment

A subscription to Subtxt requires a credit card. If you, for some reason, do not have access to a credit card but would prefer to pay through alternate means (PayPal, etc.) please contact us directly. We are able to set up alternate methods of payment for those who need it. Note that the process is manual, so it does take a bit longer to set up. 

You can contact us directly through in-app Support by selecting the **Support** button at the top of the page (the "life-preserver" icon).

## Benefits of Continuing Your Subscription

The Subtxt/Dramatica platform is more than just an application—it's an evolving tool for writers of all levels. Our system is consistently updated with new narrative structures added weekly, and our extensive collection of Storytelling Suggestions continues to grow exponentially, making it an indispensable resource for your creative process.

One of the key advantages of maintaining your subscription is instant, always-available access to Subtxt Muse. This powerful feature provides ongoing support throughout your writing process, instantly offering insights and suggestions whenever you need them. With Subtxt Muse, you'll find that your understanding of narrative structure deepens and your storytelling skills become sharper.

While you’re free to start and stop anytime, we strongly suggest staying with Subtxt. It's not just about access to an ever-growing library of resources—it's about fostering your growth as a writer and enhancing your appreciation of the art and science of narrative structure.
